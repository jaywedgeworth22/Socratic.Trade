// Real liveness probe (was an unconditional {ok:true}). A health check that can never fail is
// worse than none for a system that can hold real positions — it hides outages. This probes:
//   - DB reachability (the getInternalSetting read throws if SQLite is unwritable/locked), and
//   - scheduler liveness (age of the last tick heartbeat; stale ⇒ autonomy/stops aren't running).
// Returns 503 when a critical check fails so PM2/uptime tooling can act.
//
// TWO AUDIENCES. This route is in middleware's PUBLIC_PREFIXES, so everything it emits is
// world-readable — correct for the external uptime monitor that polls it and for the
// credential-less deploy-verify runbook (.claude/skills/deploy-verify/SKILL.md greps
// `.checks.db`, `.checks.schedulerAgeSeconds`, `.checks.storage.litestream*`). Three items are
// operator-only and are therefore gated on the SAME token as /api/ops/snapshot (`x-ops-token`,
// ops-auth.ts) rather than a second auth scheme:
//   - the OpenRouter prepaid balance in USD — publishing "the LLM budget is nearly exhausted"
//     hands an anonymous caller a precisely-timed, cheap window to drain what is (post-#1703
//     universal routing) the single point of failure for every LLM call and all RAG embedding,
//   - the host disk / SQLite byte counts — free capacity reconnaissance, and
//   - the raw scheduler-lease owner, which carries this container's OS pid.
// Gating is a PROJECTION only: `ok`, the 200/503 status, and every degraded flag are computed from
// the same values either way and are byte-identical between the two views. Do not fold any of this
// into the status logic — a spurious 503 restarts the container, which re-halts autonomy via the
// boot interlock (see the trading-liveness note below).
//
// Failure mode worth knowing: authorizeOpsRequest fails closed on an UNCONFIGURED secret — with
// neither OPS_DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN nor ADMIN_REINDEX_TOKEN set it returns false for everyone, quietly,
// so the operator sees the public view too. That is the same condition that already makes
// /api/ops/snapshot unusable, so it is a token-provisioning problem, not a health-route one; the
// full lease owner is still on /api/ready (session-gated, no ops token needed) either way.
