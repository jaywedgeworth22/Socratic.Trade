/**
 * GET /api/chat/providers — per-provider key availability for the Assistant model picker.
 * Returns ONLY booleans (never the key) so the dropdown can mark a provider whose key isn't
 * resolvable for this user. "Resolvable" uses resolveLlmCredential — the same check llmForModel
 * makes to decide real-vs-mock — so a provider shows available whenever the app can actually serve
 * it for this user. No distinction is drawn here between a user's own key and any other resolved key.
 *
 * Includes "openrouter": llmForModel now routes EVERY model through an OpenRouter key first
 * (same universal-routing precedence resolveLlmEndpoint already uses for the strategy engine —
 * see llm-provider.ts). Without this row, an owner with only an OpenRouter key attached saw every
 * Coach model reported as "no key" even though the same model already worked in the strategy
 * engine (review finding llm-12). Also includes "meta" (llama-family models) — omitted before for
 * the same reason: chatProviderForModel had no llama mapping, so the UI could never have reported
 * status for it correctly anyway.
