// Human copy for admin data-probe failures (client-side fetch error presentation).
//
// The admin API layer (src/lib/auth/admin.ts: requireAdmin/checkAdmin) can genuinely 403 a caller
// whose identity isn't a verified admin — including the dev-fallback identity in local dev, which
// middleware.ts trusts for ordinary routes but the admin gate does not, since isVerifiedIdentitySource
// (src/lib/auth/strip-identity.ts) excludes the local-fallback source. That's real, intentional auth
// behavior and this file does not change who gets in. It only controls how a probe failure already
// returned by the API is PRESENTED to the operator: plain remediation copy instead of a bare
// "HTTP 403", with the raw status kept around for a title/tooltip so it isn't lost for debugging.
