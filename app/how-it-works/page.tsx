            The interface separates confidence from permission. A strong thesis is not itself
            authority; delegated scope is. When Socratic Trade decides a selloff is a buying
            opportunity instead of a reason to retreat, the explanation must say which mandate
            allowed it, what evidence justified it, and what condition would have stopped it.
