/**
 * Apple App Site Association — the domain half of universal links.
 *
 * Apple's CDN fetches https://socratictrade.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association with NO
 * file extension and requires `application/json`, which is exactly why this is a route handler
 * (a `public/` file would need the extension to get the right content type). It must also be
 * anonymously reachable: the edge middleware's PUBLIC_PREFIXES carries this path, otherwise
 * every fetch would 307 to /login and the domain would silently never claim the app.
 *
 * `paths` is limited to the routes the iOS app actually handles (ios/SocraticTrade/
 * DeepLink.swift). Claiming more would swallow links into Safari-only pages.
