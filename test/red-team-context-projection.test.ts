// `RedTeamReviewContext` documents a CURATED subset of the Green evidence: macro, limits,
// portfolio, scorecards, analogs and the candidates under review.  The run-time review ignored it
// and spread the entire Green `userContent` instead — the full evidence budget, every scan
// candidate, the RAG pack, learned context and the reflection summary — once PER OPENING.  The
// reviewer's job is to fact-check ONE finalized proposal against the evidence for ITS symbol.
//
// Parity between the two stages is carried by `evidenceManifest.greenRedParityHash`, a
// content-addressed hash over the evidence pack.  That is what makes parity provable; re-sending
// the bodies never was.
