/**
 * Owner guardrail philosophy (2026-07-05): the agent may self-override ANY policy block with a logged
 * `autonomyOverride` thesis EXCEPT a hard gate — the account boundary or a physical / broker /
 * regulatory / accounting impossibility. `isHardGateReason` (policy.ts) is the single source of truth
 * for that split; `socratic-runtime.overrideableReason` is now just `!isHardGateReason`. This test pins
 * the split against the ACTUAL reason strings produced by evaluateTradeProposal, so a future gate edit
 * that changes a reason's wording (or a refactor that reverts the denylist) fails here.
 *
 * The critical property is the DEFAULT: an unrecognized / newly-added reason must classify as a
 * PREFERENCE (overridable), not hard — the inverse of the old allowlist, which silently made any
 * unlisted gate un-overridable.
