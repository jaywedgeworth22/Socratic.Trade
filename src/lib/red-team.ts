// The SINGLE Red Team reviewer (docs/single-adversary-consolidation.md, owner-revised 2026-07-07).
// One adversarial LLM call per risk-adding opening, run on the FINALIZED (post-sizing) trade. It
// performs BOTH jobs the two former passes split between them: the in-flow Bear's fact-check of the
// strategist's claims against the structured candidate evidence (R7), and the standalone debate's
// risk critique — returning one discrete, down-only verdict: approve / approve-at-half / reject.
//
// Deliberately ABSENT (owner directive):
// - No RED_TEAM_LLM_PROVIDER / RED_TEAM_LLM_MODEL env override and no special-cased Anthropic
//   branch: the reviewer's provider/transport come purely from the user's explicit
//   `redTeamLlmModel` via resolveLlmEndpoint(role:"red") — a claude-* Red model gets the
//   forced-tool Messages transport through the SAME shared request builder as every other site.
// - No model default and no fallback to the Green model: an unchosen Red model resolves to "" and
//   this function fails closed (`not_configured`) so the caller routes the opening to a human.
// - No hidden model failover (R11): transient failures get a small bounded same-model retry
//   (llmFetchCapturing, same soft timeout as Green); a reviewer that still can't answer
//   declares itself unavailable.
