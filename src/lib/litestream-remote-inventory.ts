/**
 * Scheduled inventory of the REMOTE Litestream replica, broken out per compaction level.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Litestream 0.5.12 keeps only level 0 in the local `ltx/0/` cache; levels 1, 2, 3 and 9 are
 * compacted straight into the remote replica (Backblaze B2) and never appear on local disk.
 * Verified on the live container 2026-08-12: `/app/data/.app.db-litestream/ltx/` contained
 * exactly one entry, `0`. Any monitor that grades higher levels from local files is therefore
 * structurally blind to them, which is precisely how a wedged level-2 compaction ran
 * unnoticed in production while every health signal stayed green.
 *
 * The IPC control socket cannot close the gap either. Litestream 0.5.12 serves exactly two
 * routes there — `/list` (path, status, last_sync_at) and `/info` (version, pid, uptime,
 * started_at, database_count); everything else 404s. Neither carries per-level data. Probed
 * against the live daemon on 2026-08-12.
 *
 * What DOES work is the pinned binary's own reader: `litestream ltx -level N -json <db>` lists
 * the remote LTX inventory for one level, including each file's txid range and timestamp. The
 * app process can run it because it is a CHILD of the litestream daemon
 * (`litestream replicate -exec "next start"` in scripts/coolify-prod-start.sh) and therefore
 * inherits the same AWS_* replica credentials.
 *
 * COST — WHY THIS IS SCHEDULED AND NEVER INLINE
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * Measured against the live replica on 2026-08-12:
 *   level 1  -> 8.3s, 5,635 files, 887 KB of JSON
 *   level 2  -> 0.9s,   171 files
 *   level 3  -> 0.7s,    15 files
 *   level 9  -> 0.7s,     8 files
 *   -level all -> 143s, 90,500 files, 14.1 MB    <- never used; level 0 dominates it
 * Roughly 11s and ~9 B2 LIST calls per refresh. At the 30-minute cadence below that is ~430
 * LIST calls/day, comfortably inside B2's free daily transaction allowance, and it keeps every
 * one of those seconds off the `/api/health` request path.
 *
 * Level 0 is deliberately NOT collected here: it is already readable locally, in real time,
 * for free, and it is the level that makes `-level all` unusable.

// CORRECTION (2026-08-13): this used to claim "`next start` serves the scheduler and every API
// route from one process, so the reader and the writer are the same process" and kept the
// snapshot in a bare module-level variable on that basis. That assumption was false in
// production: Next's build gives the scheduler (reached via instrumentation.ts's register()) and
// the API route handlers SEPARATE instantiations of this module, each with its own
// `cachedInventory` binding, even though both run inside the same OS process. The writer's
// assignment and the reader's lookup were therefore never the same variable — proven by
// production `task_journal` evidence: the `litestream-remote-inventory` lane logged 932
// successful runs / 0 errors in 24h (the collector genuinely works), while `/api/health` reported
// `remoteInventoryState: "missing"` the entire time (the reader never saw any of them). See
// docs/rollouts/2026-08-13-durable-inventory-cache.md.
//
// Fix: `getLitestreamRemoteInventory` now reads the snapshot back from `durable_state`
// (src/lib/db-durable-state.ts) on every call, so any module instance / any process on the box
// sees the same row. `cachedInventory` remains as a same-process fallback for when the durable
// read itself fails (e.g. the DB is briefly unavailable) — it is NOT the source of truth.
//
// One consequence of moving to durable storage: the snapshot now survives a process restart
// (the app auto-deploys on every merge to main, so restarts are frequent) instead of resetting to
// "not collected yet". That is intentional, not a regression — a slightly-old-but-real snapshot
// beats manufacturing another few-minute "missing" window on every deploy, and it is never shown
// as fresher than it is: assessLitestreamTierFreshness (runtime-health.ts) ages any snapshot out
// past LITESTREAM_REMOTE_INVENTORY_MAX_AGE_SECONDS (90 minutes) into an explained
// "remote-inventory-stale", the same honest-state handling a slow collector already gets today.
//
// `lastAttemptAtMs` (the 30-minute collection gate) deliberately STAYS in-memory-only — see the
// comment on refreshLitestreamRemoteInventoryIfDue below for why that is safe.

 * cadence gate to lose track of, unlike the snapshot itself, which genuinely does need to cross
 * module instances to reach the API routes. Production evidence backs this: the
 * `litestream-remote-inventory` lane fired on every ~63s scheduler tick (932 runs/24h) but only
 * ran the real (multi-second, B2-listing) collection 32 times — matching the 30-minute cadence
 * exactly, which is only possible if `lastAttemptAtMs` held its value correctly across all 932
 * ticks. Making this durable would add a DB round trip to every tick for no correctness gain,
 * and risks the opposite failure this file's cost comment warns about: a debounced durable write
 * that hasn't landed yet by the next ~60s tick could make the gate re-fire far more often than
 * every 30 minutes, turning ~430 B2 LIST calls/day into tens of thousands.
