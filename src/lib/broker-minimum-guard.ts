// broker-minimum-guard.ts — pre-flight guard for orders that are GUARANTEED to be rejected for
// landing below the active broker's minimum dollar-based/fractional order size.
//
// Root cause this exists for (2026-07-08): the live Robinhood "Agentic" account (~$4-5 NAV) tried
// an AAPL concentration trim every hour, forever. Sizing (maxOrderPctOfNav) clamped each trim to
// ~$0.20-0.23 — always under Robinhood's $1 minimum — so `placeEquityOrder` rejected it every time,
// producing a `run_failed` alert 11x/day with no end in sight. Robinhood's own `review_equity_order`
// pre-flight already announced this in advance (`order_checks.alertType` ==
// EQUITY_DOLLAR_BASED_MINIMUM_AMOUNT_ERROR / EQUITY_SUB_DOLLAR_SHARE_BASED_ORDER — parsed into
// `ReviewedOrder.preflightBlock` by robinhood.ts) but nothing read it before this module.
//
// This is a CORRECTNESS fix, not a paternalistic cap: it only ever intercepts an order the broker
// has already told us (or that basic sizing math tells us) cannot possibly succeed at its current
// notional. It never blocks a valid order, and it carries no opinion on whether the underlying
// trim/rebalance idea is good — the owner can still raise the trim size, trim manually, or ignore it.
