// r2-cold-snapshot.ts — weekly cold snapshot of the production SQLite DB to Cloudflare R2.
//
// Owner directive (2026-08-08): with litestream's active replica moved to Backblaze B2
// (PR #2584), the R2 bucket sits idle — use it intelligently as SECOND-PROVIDER disaster
// recovery. Once a week (Sunday ~03:17 UTC, staggered off the top of the hour), take a
// consistent better-sqlite3 `backup()` of the live DB to a temp file, stream it through
// gzip, and multipart-upload the compressed stream to the historic R2 bucket under
// `cold-snapshots/app-<ISO-date>.db.gz`, then prune to the newest N (default 1) snapshots
// across BOTH extensions (`.db` legacy raw uploads and `.db.gz`).
//
// Gzip (2026-08-31, PR #3135): the raw DB reached ~9.7 GB, putting one uncompressed
// weekly copy at ~90% of the 10 GiB R2 free tier.  The upload now streams the backup
// file through node zlib createGzip into sequential multipart parts — memory stays
// bounded at roughly one part (default 100 MB) plus zlib buffers, never the whole file
// (the box has 16 GB of SHARED RAM).  Expected compressed size ~2.5-4 GB.  No
// compression knob — always gzip.  RESTORE now needs a gunzip step first: download the
// `.db.gz`, `gunzip` it, then treat the result exactly like the old raw `.db` snapshot
// (see docs/litestream.md).
//
// Skip-prune (opt-in only): `R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_SKIP_PRUNE=1` bypasses the entire
// retention pass — leave it UNSET for normal Sunday jobs.  Default retain is 4
// (`R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_DEFAULT_RETAIN`); the prune pass then keeps the newest N
// across `.db` + `.db.gz`.  Agents must never DeleteObject against this bucket
// outside the automated retention pass without Jay approval.
//
// Budget stance: stays reliably far under the R2 free tier. One weekly run costs roughly
// 30-45 Class A ops (create + ~25-40 compressed parts at 100 MB + complete + list + up to
// a couple deletes) ≈ 200/month vs the 1M free-tier allowance; storage is
// retain×compressed-size.  Default retain is 4 (ceiling `R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_MAX_RETAIN`).
// The retention pass counts + prunes both `.db` and `.db.gz`.  Host-verified notes
// from 2026-08-18 (pre-gzip, retain=1) are historical.  `R2_ARCHIVE_KEEP_GENERATIONS`
// is unused leftover (empty `weekly/` prefix) and must not drive this lane.
// Do not delete live R2 objects from agents.  A budget guard refuses
// to run at all when the r2-usage monitor's latest ST snapshot shows month-to-date Class A
// ops above 50% of the free tier. The R2 free-tier kill-switch in r2-usage.ts is untouched
// (it is gated to litestream's endpoint being R2, which it no longer is).
//
// Scheduling: a durable weekly due-job (db-jobs.ts, job_type "r2_cold_snapshot") rather
// than an in-process interval — the snapshot survives process downtime: if the box is down
// over Sunday 03:17 UTC, the pending job is claimed on the next scheduler tick after boot.
// The scheduler tick both (a) ensures the next weekly job exists (idempotent via dedupe
// key) and (b) drains due jobs.
//
// Gating: silently a no-op (with ONE audit row per distinct reason) unless the
// AWS_R2_HISTORIC_* credentials + bucket + endpoint from PR #2584 are configured.
// R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_ENABLED=0/off/false/no is the explicit kill switch.
// R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_SKIP_PRUNE=1/true/on/yes is the opt-in freshen gate (default off).
//
// Snapshot mechanism (2026-09-08, CLAUDE): `VACUUM INTO` in a short-lived CHILD PROCESS,
// NOT better-sqlite3 `backup()`.  Root cause of the 9-day archive stall: SQLite's online
// backup API restarts from page 1 whenever the source DB is modified through a DIFFERENT
// connection (sqlite3_backup_step -> SQLITE_BUSY/restart).  app.db is written continuously
// by the live trading app AND checkpointed by litestream, so on a ~10.7 GB DB the copy can
// never outrun the writers.  Production evidence 2026-09-08: the temp backup file sat at
// exactly 5666406400 bytes across three samples 8 minutes apart while its mtime advanced
// every few seconds, and `week-2026-09-06` reached attempts=27 with `last_error` NULL and
// ZERO `r2_cold_snapshot.error`/`.success` audit rows — it hung, it never failed.  Locally
// reproduced on better-sqlite3 13.0.3 (the production version): 2698 restarts in 15s with
// remainingPages pinned at 10601/10701.  `VACUUM INTO` runs inside ONE read transaction, so
// concurrent writers cannot restart it; it also emits a COMPACTED copy (smaller upload).  It
// is synchronous and would block the event loop for minutes, so it runs in a child process
// spawned with a MINIMAL env (no secrets) and is killed at the deadline below.
//
// Deadline: every snapshot attempt is bounded by R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_DEADLINE_MIN (default 45,
// well under the 2h job lease) so a stuck snapshot FAILS LOUDLY instead of hanging until the
// lease expires and the next drain silently restarts it.  Bounding the attempt below the
// lease also stops overlapping attempts from piling up inside one process lifetime (each
// attempt's start-of-run sweep unlinks the previous attempt's temp file while that attempt
// still holds the fd — invisible multi-GB disk usage).
//
// Failure: audited, surfaced once via the existing storage_warning notification path
// (db-health.ts alertStorageWarning — 12h per-warning-type cooldown) AND as a Sentry
// structured log, then retried with due-job backoff. Never throws into the scheduler tick.
//
// Freshness watchdog: `reportR2WeeklyFreshness()` (called from the scheduler lane) watches
// the SAME `checks.storage.r2Weekly` state the public health endpoint publishes and emits
// ONE Sentry event per state TRANSITION (ok <-> archive_stale/archive_not_run), persisted in
// an internal setting.  Before this, nothing watched that field: the archive went stale on
// 2026-09-06 and was still silent 9 days later.

// Bare "fs"/"os"/"path" (not the "node:" scheme) so Next.js webpack can externalize this
// module for server bundles — same trap as r2-usage.ts / egress-guard.
