/**
 * First-call retry for an in-process Alpaca REST read, without treating a real
 * rejection as success.
 *
 * ASC + ops (2026-08-18, process 581467e1 / later d4299bec): there is no Alpaca
 * sidecar.  Paper / Roth are REST `alpaca`.  alpaca-broker was 500/500 ok this
 * process, but 191/500 calls were ≥6s (min 97ms / avg ~3085ms / max 14416ms).
 * Latest ~4:40pm CT 98–413ms ok; ~30s earlier several ok at 6570–6600ms — the
 * SDK finished AFTER the 6s `withDeadline` abort.  Same window also aborted
 * portfolio/positions/orders at 8s and getEquityQuotes at 6s.  `ftsMirrorSlice`
 * held the same event loop 6–12s.  First wait is above the live 14.4s max.
 * A 401 / credential throw still fails immediately (no retry).
