// prompt-safety.ts — deterministic, ADVISORY-ONLY receipts for the money-path prompts.
//
// Three pure scanners live here (CR-H prompt-safety lane, 2026-07-05; corpus-coverage-receipt,
// 2026-07-06):
//   1. scanForInjectionAttempts — a small, curated regex sweep over the UNTRUSTED text blocks
//      that get assembled into the Bull/Bear prompts (headlines, smart-money bulletins, RAG
//      snippets, learned facts, episodic blocks, the owner strategy prompt incl. its AI-LEARNED
//      appends, and the reflection summary).
//   2. collectEvidenceAgeAnomalies — flags evidence that is suspiciously FRESH (first seen <24h
//      before the run): a high-relevance RAG chunk dated today, or a learned fact asserted today.
//   3. computeEmptyDocTypes — flags a requested filings doc type that produced zero chunks THIS
//      run AND has zero ever-ingested rows (corpus-wide) — i.e. evidence that structurally cannot
//      exist yet, not just a normal low-relevance miss.
//
// OWNER PHILOSOPHY (binding): detection IS the control. Findings become audit rows and
// decision-case evidence items — the scanned text is NEVER altered, dropped, or blocked, and
// generation always proceeds. This is a receipt printer, not a gate.
//
// This is a LEAF module: no imports, no DB, no I/O — so it is trivially unit-testable and can
// never entangle the strategy money path.
