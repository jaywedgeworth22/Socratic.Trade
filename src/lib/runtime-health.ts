 * order IS write order (verified on the live replica: the lexicographically greatest name in

 * That gap is exactly what let a stuck level-1 B2 compaction anchor run silently for 27+
 * hours in production on 2026-08-11 (level 0 kept succeeding every ~60s the entire time —

 *   - level 0: litestream.coolify.yml syncs every 60s. 10 minutes is ~10x that cadence,
 *     generous headroom for one missed tick while still catching a genuinely stuck sync
 *     in minutes rather than hours.
 *   - level 1: compaction is periodic, not continuous, so healthy operation naturally goes
 *     quiet between runs — there is no fixed interval to anchor a tight threshold to. 4
 *     hours tolerates ordinary gaps while catching a stuck compactor (this incident's
 *     failure mode) in a few hours instead of the 27+ hours it actually took.
 *   - level 2: 5-minute monitor interval, but output only appears when enough level-1
 *     input has accumulated — quiet stretches are normal.  2 hours (24x the interval)
 *     still catches a wedged retry loop (the 2026-08-12 incident shape) same-day.
 *   - level 3: 1-hour monitor interval, same accumulation caveat. 6 hours.
 *   - level 9: `snapshot.interval: 24h`. 30 hours (24h + 6h buffer) rides out one
 *     delayed/retried run without false-alarming on ordinary scheduling jitter.
 *
 * Every threshold above 10 minutes is graded from the remote replica inventory, which
 * refreshes every 30 minutes and is discarded once it exceeds
 * LITESTREAM_REMOTE_INVENTORY_MAX_AGE_SECONDS (90 min).  Both are far below the tightest

/**
 * Per-compaction-level backup freshness, from the two sources that genuinely exist.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SEE (the whole point of the 2026-08-12 rewrite — the previous
 * version claimed to cover levels 0/1/2/3/9 and in production covered NONE of them):
 *
 *  - **Level 0** is read from the local `ltx/0/` directory. Real-time, free, always available
 *    wherever Litestream runs beside the app.
 *  - **Levels 1/2/3/9** exist ONLY in the remote replica. They are read from an out-of-band
 *    inventory collected on a schedule by src/lib/litestream-remote-inventory.ts (which shells
 *    out to the pinned `litestream ltx -level N -json` binary). That listing costs real
 *    Backblaze B2 requests and up to ~8s for level 1, so it must never run inline in a health
 *    request — this function only ever READS an already-collected snapshot.
 *  - **Litestream's own `compaction failed` log lines** — the most direct evidence of the
 *    2026-08-12 wedge — are NOT obtainable. They go to the container's stdout pipe, which is
 *    owned by the Docker log collector; the app can only reach it by draining the same pipe
 *    and stealing lines from `docker logs`. Not viable, so this monitor infers the wedge from
 *    a level that stops advancing instead.
 *
 * A level with no usable signal reports `state: "not-observable"` with a specific reason,
 * never a bare "unknown".
 *
 * THREE states, not two (2026-08-14). A level whose listing SUCCEEDED and returned zero objects
 * reports `state: "empty"` with a `verdict`, because that is a MEASUREMENT and belongs nowhere
 * near "we cannot see this". Until 2026-08-14 it was filed under `not-observable` with the
 * reason `no-activity-recorded` and the detail "This is normal for a level Litestream has not
 * needed to produce" — which is exactly backwards for the failure that was live in production
 * at the time: level 2 held zero objects while level 1 held 2,032 and was still advancing, i.e.
 * the level litestream most certainly DID need to produce. `/api/health` reported no degraded
 * reason and the deep-compaction outage stayed invisible for six days. See
 * docs/rollouts/2026-08-14-empty-tier-wedge-detection.md.
 *
 * Never throws: a missing state directory, an unreadable path, or an absent inventory all
 * degrade to an explained `not-observable`, so this stays safe to call from any environment
 * (tests, local dev) where Litestream is not running at all.

 * S3/B2 credentials, does not depend on the remote LTX inventory
 * (src/lib/litestream-remote-inventory.ts, whose scheduler wiring has a separate known bug in
 * flight elsewhere), and works even when every compaction tier above is "not-observable". It is
 * also strictly narrower: it can only ever prove a failure happened recently (a real alarm,
 * folded into storageDegraded by the caller), never that everything is fine -- an empty result
 * here means "no evidence of failure in the tail we read", not "confirmed healthy", so callers
 * must not treat it as a positive health signal on its own.
 *
 * Never throws. A missing file (litestream not running this boot, or not yet past its first
 * `-exec`) reports no findings rather than an error -- the same "not-observable, not fabricated"
 * posture the rest of this module uses, just expressed as "nothing found" because there is no
 * separate not-observable state to report for what is fundamentally a best-effort grep.
 *
 * Known, accepted imprecision: the tail read can start mid-line, so a marker string that
 * straddles exactly that byte boundary could be missed on one check. A sustained wedge repeats
 * the same failure every compaction-monitor interval (30s-1h depending on level), so the next
 * health check's shifted tail window overwhelmingly does not land on the same boundary twice --
 * this is a retried, best-effort signal, not a one-shot guarantee.
