  //                       (disallowed loss × shortTermRatePct). The strategy loop turns it into
  //                       a pending-approval card (both propose and decide authority). Approving
  //                       that card re-runs THIS gate with a server-stored override token

  //                       itself wrote) — the ONLY way a locked buy passes in "ask" mode.

  //                       veto here would just re-arithmetize the LLM's own outputs — confidence,

  //
  // IRA-REPLACEMENT RULE (Rev. Rul. 2008-5): when the BUYING account is a roth/traditional

  // (IRA losses never contribute locks — see tax.ts), and buying the replacement inside the IRA
  // PERMANENTLY destroys the disallowed loss. Governed by taxSettings.iraWashSaleHandling:
  //   "block" — hard block in EVERY washSaleHandling mode, ignoring override tokens, and —
  //     unlike the taxable-buyer lockout — even when the per-account washSaleGuard flag is off:
  //     resolveTaxSettings deliberately force-disables that flag for IRAs (a wash sale has no
  //     benefit INSIDE the account), so it cannot switch off the cross-account permanent-harm
  //     rule. Available as a stricter per-account opt-in; no longer the default.
  //   "disregard" (DEFAULT) — the buy PROCEEDS through the normal authority flow (all other
  //     gates unchanged). Rationale (owner decision 2026-07-03): brokers do not report
  //     cross-account IRA wash sales to the IRS — the rule only bites under audit — so
  //     respecting it is the account owner's call, not a hard system stop. NEVER silent:
  //     decision.washSale records outcome "ira_disregarded" with the verbatim
  //     IRA_WASH_SALE_DISREGARD_NOTE plus the priced provenance, the run loop / approval path
