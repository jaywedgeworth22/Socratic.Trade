// DEFAULT OFF: with `policy.tuning.congressGoNoGoGating` unset the multiplier is always 1 (no change) —
// the congress term is applied unconditionally exactly as today. When the flag is on, a "no-go" verdict
// (the eval's own goNoGo.pass === false) zeroes the congress contribution so a statistically-unvalidated
// signal can no longer lift a name into the candidate set or up the composite.
//
// The verdict is CACHED in the `settings` table (written by a periodic refresh — the offline eval script
// or `refreshCongressScoreVerdict`) and read cheaply at scan time; the expensive OHLC-backed evaluation
// never runs inside a scan cycle.
