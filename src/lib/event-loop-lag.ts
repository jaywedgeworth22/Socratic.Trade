// event-loop-lag.ts — continuous event-loop stall accounting for the safety lanes.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-09, seat CLAUDE).  The scheduler's two protective lanes —
// `synthetic-stop-monitor` and `stale-limit-scan` — race their work against a 15s
// `withDeadline` and, on expiry, report `runSyntheticStopMonitor timeout` /
// `stale-limit-scan broker timeout`.  Production evidence says that message is WRONG about
// the cause, and the wrong cause sent PR #3189 after broker retries that could not help:
//
//   * task_journal, `stale-limit-scan` @ 2026-09-08T19:51:57.566Z — duration 185_633ms with
//     error "Timed out waiting for alpaca.getOrders after 16000+8000ms."  The inner broker
//     call SELF-TERMINATED at 24_000ms, so 161_633ms of that lane elapsed outside all broker
//     I/O.  No network explanation reaches that number.
//   * task_journal, `synthetic-stop-monitor` @ 2026-09-09T13:45:41.103Z — duration 196_840ms,
//     status `ok`, summary `evaluated=6 triggered=0 exited=0`.  The monitor SUCCEEDED; it was
//     merely 13x past the deadline that had already logged it as a broker timeout.
//   * Passes with `evaluated=0` still took 30_000–134_000ms.  A pass with nothing to evaluate
//     makes two bounded reads whose transport ceiling is 30s each — it cannot spend 134s on
//     the network.
//   * The two lanes are independent (different endpoints, different call counts) yet their
//     slow runs start within 2-3ms of each other and match durations to ~100ms across 130s.
//     That is a shared process-wide stall, not two independent broker slowdowns.
//
// So the deadline is really a liveness probe on a blocked event loop, mislabelled as broker
// latency.  This module measures the stall directly so the lanes can say which one it was.
//
// Cost is one unref'd 500ms timer and a bounded ring buffer.  It changes NO lane behavior:
// nothing here cancels, retries, delays, or shortens a protective monitor pass.
