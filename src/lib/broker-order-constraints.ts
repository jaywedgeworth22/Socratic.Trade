// Per-broker ORDER-SHAPE CONSTRAINT TABLES (oss-lessons §7 slice 2 — Lean discipline: each
// broker's order-type constraints are DATA, validated BEFORE submission, with a unit test per
// constraint — instead of being learned one production 422 at a time).
//
// Enforced at the single placement choke point (broker.ts getBrokerGateway wraps every gateway
// in withOrderConstraints), so all placement lanes — strategy loop, approval path, protective
// stops, synthetic stops, order replacement — are covered in EVERY environment. That matters:
// the motivating incident (Alpaca 422 "bracket orders must be entry orders" on a T sell,
// docs/rollouts/2026-07-27-pending-orders-done-for-day.md) happened on Alpaca PAPER.
//
// Two remedies, chosen per constraint:
// - "reshape": the order's INTENT is valid but carries fields the broker would reject or
//   silently drop — the table produces a corrected input and the choke point audits a receipt
//   (`order_constraint_reshaped`). Used where blocking would be worse than fixing (never block
//   an EXIT over decorative bracket legs), mirroring enrichOpeningProposal's strip-with-receipt
//   precedent.
// - "block": the order cannot be honestly expressed on this broker (e.g. trailPercent on a
//   gateway with no native trailing — silently placing a non-trailing order would leave a
//   position believed-protected but not). Throws OrderValidationError, which the strategy and
//   approval lanes already classify as proposal status "blocked" (never "rejected_by_broker").
//
// Adding a constraint: only encode rules with a receipt — a broker doc, a production 422, or an
// adapter check being promoted — never a guessed rule (a wrong block here stops real orders).
// Some rows intentionally duplicate adapter-internal checks (the adapter keeps its own copy as
// defense in depth); the per-constraint tests in test/broker-order-constraints.test.ts pin both.
