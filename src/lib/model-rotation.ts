// model-rotation.ts — the "__rotate__" comparative-measurement option: rotate the Proposer (green) and/or
// Reviewer (red) model through every eligible curated model, a different one each strategy run.
//
// PURPOSE (owner request 2026-07-08): accrue attributed comparative history across models on the
// selected broker account. Proposals already persist `proposedByModel` (the CONCRETE serving model),
// so attribution is automatic — rotation only has to vary which model serves each run.
//
// REASONING EFFORT (per-team split 2026-07-10): a rotating seat has NO manual effort control —
// each rotated model is served at its curated recommended reasoning effort (unknown -> "medium";
// src/lib/model-reasoning-recommendations.ts), carried on the same run-scoped override as the
// model pick (green -> llmReasoningEffort, red -> redTeamReasoningEffort) and recorded on the
// `model_rotation_pick` audit. The persisted per-team efforts are untouched.
//
// HOW IT RESOLVES: `runStrategyOnce` calls `resolveModelRotationForRun` at the TOP of every run,
// BEFORE any budget preview or `resolveLlmEndpoint` call, and merges the result onto its
// RUN-SCOPED policy clone (`runPolicy`) — the same pattern as the usage-budget downgrade. The
// PERSISTED policy keeps the sentinel so the NEXT run rotates again; nothing downstream (endpoint
// resolution, timeouts, `proposedByModel` stamping) ever sees "__rotate__". A safety net in
// `resolveOpenAiModel` (llm-request.ts) covers consumers that read the persisted policy outside a
// run (chat, lesson pass, tuning): they fail closed, never serving the literal sentinel.
//
// POINTER STATE: independent per-seat round-robin counters persisted via internal settings, keyed
// `model_rotation:<userId>:<accountId>:<seat>`. To vary green/red COMBINATIONS rather than locking
// phase (both counters advancing by 1 per run = a fixed pairing), the red counter advances one
// EXTRA step whenever the green counter wraps a full cycle. Additionally, when BOTH seats rotate,
// a run never serves the SAME model to both: if red's slot would equal green's pick, red skips one
// slot forward (pool >= 2 only — a 1-model pool degenerates to same-model by necessity). Without
// the skip, both counters start at 0, so proposer and reviewer served identical models for the
// entire first cycle (pairings only de-phased after the first green wrap). The pointer advance +
// pick audit are
// COMMITTED LATE: `resolveModelRotationForRun` computes the picks early (so the budget preview can
// price the concrete models) but returns a `commit()` the caller only invokes once the run is
// actually committed to serving the LLM — after account validation and the usage-budget skip gate.
// A run that aborts earlier holds the pointer, so a rotation slot is never burned on a run that
// generated no proposal (no `proposedByModel` to match). Per-account run locks serialize same-account
// runs, so the read-early / commit-late window has no TOCTOU.
