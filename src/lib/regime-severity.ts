// Multi-signal regime severity scorer (Lane 5 — credit spreads + VIX term structure + breadth).
//
// `MARKET_REGIME_SEVERITY` (market-regime.ts) is a flat per-enum-bucket lookup with zero
// consumers today — it only reflects VIX + the yield curve (the two inputs `classifyMarketRegime`
// already sees). This module is a NEW, parallel, dependency-light blender that widens the signal
// set (VIX term structure, HY credit spread, market breadth, VVIX, SKEW) into one continuous
// [0, 1] severity score, WITHOUT touching `market-regime.ts`'s pinned enum/label/severity
// contracts or its dependency-free-module guarantee (this file is not imported by it and does
// not import it for values it doesn't already need — see below).
//
// Design contract:
//   - Pure function of its inputs. No fetches, no DB, no imports beyond the `MarketRegime` type.
//   - Never fabricates: a missing input is simply absent from `components` and its weight is
//     redistributed across whatever IS available (never defaulted to a guessed number).
//   - The classified enum's own severity (`MARKET_REGIME_SEVERITY[regime]`) is a FLOOR, not an
//     input to the blend — the composite can only ADD caution vs. today's channel, never dilute
//     a crisis reading with calm continuous signals.
//   - Zero available continuous inputs → severity collapses to the floor, `inputsUsed: 0`.
//
// This module intentionally does NOT change any gate/cap behavior (crisis cap, bear filter,
// escalation trigger) — it is a new advisory/receipt channel only. See
// docs/rollouts/2026-07-05-multi-signal-regime-scorer.md for the wiring decisions and the
// explicit "feeding caps" scoping deferral.
