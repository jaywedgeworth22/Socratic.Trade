// True broker-held protective stops — two kinds, one reconciler:
//
//  - FIXED (Robinhood, opt-in `robinhoodBrokerStops`): Robinhood's MCP cannot hold a native OCO
//    bracket (unlike Alpaca), so a held position is otherwise protected only by the app's synthetic
//    scheduler-tick monitor — a single point of failure if the app is offline. This lane places a
//    resting broker-side stop-market SELL (GTC) at stopLossPct below entry for each open Robinhood
//    LIVE long, and cancels it when the position closes or a synthetic exit fires (so an orphaned
//    stop can't sell shares we no longer hold).
//
//  - TRAILING (`brokerTrailingStops`, default on; inert until riskRules.trailingStopPct > 0):
//     * Alpaca REST (paper or live): a TRUE native `trailing_stop` order (trail_percent) — the
//       broker trails the high-water mark itself, so the trail keeps moving even while the app is
//       down.
//     * Alpaca MCP: the ratcheted emulation below, through the account's own MCP transport — an
//       MCP-endpoint-only account has no REST keys for the native lane.
//     * Robinhood (live, additionally gated on `robinhoodBrokerStops` — the "resting stops at RH
//       are live-verified" opt-in): the RH MCP exposes no verified native trailing parameter, so
//       this lane places a resting GTC stop-market at trailingStopPct below the high-water mark and
//       RATCHETS it upward (cancel-replace) each tick as the price rises. Between ticks the broker
//       holds a real fixed stop — protection survives app downtime; the trail catches up on the
//       app's cadence.
//    Trailing takes precedence over fixed when both lanes apply: shares can only back ONE resting
//    sell order at the broker, so a position carries either the trailing or the fixed broker stop,
//    never both (the synthetic monitor still layers the other rule on its tick, as always).
//
// Reconciliation runs from the synthetic-stop monitor each tick: it CANCELS stops for closed
// positions every time (risk-reducing, always safe) and PLACES missing stops only when the system is
// running. This self-heals — a restart re-places any missing stops for still-open positions. The
// enabling flags gate only PLACEMENT: when no lane is enabled any more, reconcile still CANCELS
// every stop the feature previously placed for the account, so disabling tears its resting stops
// down instead of orphaning them. Placement is coverage-aware when the caller supplies its order
// list: a position whose shares are already backed by another live exit-side order (an Alpaca OCO
// bracket stop leg, a manual GTC sell) is skipped/right-sized instead of provoking a broker
// rejection. The always-on synthetic monitor remains the fallback, so this is purely additive
// protection.
//
// A pending_cancel row whose cancel call keeps failing (e.g. "order not found" after an earlier
// attempt actually landed broker-side) would otherwise retry forever and permanently block
// re-placement for that symbol. The caller's freshly fetched order list (`orders`, optional) lets
// section 1 recover: if the order shows up there already done resting (filled/rejected/canceled/
// expired), the row is deleted instead of retried again. Absent-from-list or still-live stays
// ambiguous and keeps retrying — never assume terminal without positive evidence. A rejected/
// canceled/expired recovery never moved the position, so section 4 may re-place in the SAME call;
// a FILLED recovery did move it, and the caller fetches `positions` before `orders`, so that one
// case defers re-placement to the next call rather than risk sizing off a stale pre-fill quantity.

 * Sweeps `pending_bracket_teardowns` (enqueued by recordStopPlan/clearStopPlans in db-api-keys.ts
 * whenever a "fixed"/"atr" plan with a tracked broker-native bracket changes away from that style)
 * and asks the broker gateway to identify + cancel that bracket's still-resting sibling legs — the
 * long-deferred "OCO sibling-identity pairing" gap (PR #1331/#1371): `enrichOpeningProposal` only
 * strips bracket fields from the NEW order being placed, with no reach into an EARLIER opening's
 * already-resting bracket. Cancellation is broker-gateway-optional (`cancelBracketSiblingLegs` is
 * undefined on an adapter with no bracket support, e.g. Robinhood) — a row on such an account is
 * simply dropped immediately, since no bracket could have been placed there to begin with. A row is
 * removed once cancellation is attempted (successfully or not) unless the broker call itself threw,
 * in which case attempts is bumped and the row is retried next tick up to MAX_BRACKET_TEARDOWN_ATTEMPTS.
