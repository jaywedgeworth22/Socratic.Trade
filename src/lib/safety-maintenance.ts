 *   * no AbortController is passed, so the protective work is never cancelled — it keeps
 *     running to completion exactly as before,
 *   * the expiry still rejects, so the caller still records a lane failure and still escalates
 *     to `lane_degraded` on a streak.
 *
 * What changes is that the rejection now says whether the 15s was spent waiting on a broker or
 * spent on a pinned event loop, and a pass that finishes late is no longer invisible.  Before
 * this, `synthetic-stop-monitor` could log `runSyntheticStopMonitor timeout` and then quietly
 * complete `ok evaluated=6` 196s later, leaving an operator with no way to tell whether stops
 * had in fact been monitored.
