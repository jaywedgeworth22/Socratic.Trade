// Shared types for the backend "web sources" subsystem.
//
// These connectors read data from sources that have NO free, key-based API — most
// of it is scraped/parsed from public disclosure sites (Senate eFD, SEC EDGAR) or
// public JSON back-ends (Capitol Trades). Everything here runs server-side only.
//
// Design rules (see docs/phase-9-web-sources.md):
//   1. Never fabricate. If every adapter fails, the connector yields NOTHING — the
//      dashboard shows "—" and the agent simply has no signal, never a fake one.
//   2. Low frequency. Each connector refreshes on its own cadence (default daily),
//      gated by a persisted "fetchedAt" timestamp so restarts don't re-scrape.
//   3. Persisted. Datasets live in the SQLite `settings` KV via setInternalSetting,
//      so a scrape survives a server restart and is reused until the next refresh.
