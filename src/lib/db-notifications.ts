 *
 * The pre-marker blanket rule ("any run_failed carrying a proposalId/orderId is protected") was

 * proposalId/refId. Legacy rows persisted before the marker existed fall back to matching the
 * enumerated titles/summaries.

 *   - :2399 — the ONLY order-agnostic run_failed emitter — title "Strategy run failed",
 *     payload { runId, summary }: a plain LLM/provider run-level failure with no order at stake and
 *     no reconcile marker, so it remains sweepable.
 *   - reconcile-path emitters (order confirmed NOT placed) carry reconcile: "not_placed" and are
