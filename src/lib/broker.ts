/**
 * Wrap a gateway so `placeEquityOrder` runs the default-off live pre-flight guard first. This is the

 * synthetic stops, broker protective stops, order replacement, and any future caller — so real capital
 * is never committed unless `ALLOW_LIVE_TRADING` is set AND the connected account's environment is
 * genuinely live.
 *
 * `cancelEquityOrder` is deliberately NOT guarded here: cancelling is RISK-REDUCING, and an operator
 * who disables live trading in an emergency must still be able to cancel outstanding live orders /
 * stale protective stops (manual `/api/orders/cancel`, cancel-on-close cleanup, etc.). The narrow
 * cancel-THEN-place workflows (order replacement, protective-stop reconcile) instead run the pre-flight
 * BEFORE their own cancel phase (see `livePreflightBlocks`), so they fail atomically with no orphaned
 * cancel — without blocking standalone cancels.
 *
 * No-op on the broker/paper path. Execution state is derived lazily (only when a placement actually
 * runs) so read-only gateway uses pay no extra DB cost. A Proxy (not mutation) keeps the underlying
 * gateway untouched, so re-resolving the gateway can never double-wrap it.
