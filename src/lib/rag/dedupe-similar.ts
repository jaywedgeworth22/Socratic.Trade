/**
 * Near-duplicate suppression before slice-to-limit (R14, 2026-07-01 RAG backlog).
 *
 * The retrieval pipeline never de-dups near-identical chunks — `chunk.ts`'s ~12% chunk overlap
 * plus duplicate/near-duplicate 8-K summaries mean a small final context (3 slots for
 * strategy.ts, 5 for chat) can end up being restatements of one passage rather than diverse
 * coverage. This is a greedy Jaccard-shingle filter: walk the pool in its current (already
 * ranked) order, keep a candidate unless it is >=`threshold` similar to an ALREADY-KEPT chunk,
 * and back-fill from the remaining pool so the final count still reaches `limit` when enough
 * distinct candidates exist.
 *
 * Pure, dependency-free (reuses `tokenize` from hybrid.ts) — no Pinecone/Voyage/DB imports.
 * O(k^2) shingle-set comparisons at k<=50 (the overFetchK ceiling) is trivial.
 *
 * Default OFF: `retrieveContextDetailed` only invokes this when the caller sets
 * `RetrieveOptions.dedupeSimilarity` (a 0-1 Jaccard threshold). Omitted = current behavior
 * (no dedup pass at all).

 * Optional out-param (review fix, 2026-07-06): when passed, `dedupeSimilar` reports which INPUT
 * indices it dropped for each of the two genuinely-different reasons a candidate can be absent
 * from the return value:
 *  - `genuineDuplicateIndices` — the candidate was, AT LEAST ONCE (first pass or back-fill),
 *    compared via Jaccard similarity against the kept set and found >= `threshold` similar to an
 *    already-kept chunk. This is a real near-dup judgment — it can happen in the first pass (where
 *    the candidate is `deferred` for a possible back-fill retry) or be reconfirmed in back-fill;
 *    either way it counts once it has ever been judged similar.
 *  - `neverReachedIndices` — the candidate was NEVER compared at all, in either pass, because
 *    `kept.length >= limit` had already been hit before its turn came up. This is pure
 *    top-`limit` cap truncation, NOT a duplicate judgment — `dedupeSimilar` would have kept it (or
 *    judged it a dup) if `limit` had been higher, but it never got the chance to say which. Note
 *    this can ONLY happen on a candidate's FIRST visit: a `deferred` candidate (already judged a
 *    duplicate once in the first pass) that hits a full cap during back-fill is still a genuine
 *    duplicate — it was compared, just never re-confirmed — so it stays in
 *    `genuineDuplicateIndices`, not `neverReachedIndices`.
 *
 * Every input index ends up in exactly one of: the returned `kept` array, `genuineDuplicateIndices`,
 * or `neverReachedIndices`. Passing this param does not change `dedupeSimilar`'s return value or
 * behavior in any way — it only adds bookkeeping around the existing loops.
