// (which only triggers a run when TRIGGER_ENGINE is on — otherwise a free, observable signal).

 * and the bear filter (strategy.ts) can never silently desync on a regime relabel — the
 * string-coupling the typed `MarketRegime` enum was introduced to kill.
 *
 * Imported from ./market-regime (a dependency-free module), NOT ./macro: test/regime-watch.test.ts
 * mocks the ENTIRE `./macro` module (`vi.doMock("../src/lib/macro", ...)`), so importing the typed
 * helpers from ./macro would return `undefined` under that mock. ./market-regime is unmocked, so the
 * real classifier runs. Behavior is unchanged on every canonical persisted label (crisis / risk-off /
 * cautious-inverted → escalation; neutral / risk-on → not) AND on the test's non-canonical
 * "Neutral (Moderate)" (→ unknown → not); a non-canonical free-text label now reads non-escalating
 * rather than accidentally matching a substring.
