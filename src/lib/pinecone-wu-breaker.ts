// Monthly Pinecone write-unit (WU) exhaustion breaker.
//
// Why this exists (prod, 2026-08): the Pinecone Starter plan caps writes at 2M WUs per
// CALENDAR MONTH. Once a 10-K backfill exhausted it, every hourly ingest cycle kept
// (1) re-EMBEDDING the same documents through paid OpenRouter — storeContexts dedups by
// content_hash of documents that actually STORED, so a failed upsert never records a hash and
// the next cycle pays for the embeds again before the upsert 429s again; (2) spamming
// provider_degraded alerts; (3) churning the durable sec_ingest retry queue. Nothing about
// retrying earlier than the 1st of next month can succeed, so this breaker parks all vector
// WRITES until then. Reads/RAG retrieval are unaffected and stay un-gated.
//
// Owner philosophy check: this is a spend/correctness guard (same class as the R2
// kill-switch), not a trading guardrail — it prevents paying for embeddings that provably
// cannot be stored. It self-clears on expiry AND eagerly on any successful Pinecone write
// (plan upgraded mid-month), and the marker is one internal-settings row the owner can
// delete at any time (see docs/rollouts/2026-08-09-pinecone-wu-breaker.md for the one-liner).
//
// WEBPACK TRAP: this module is reachable from scheduler-adjacent code — do not import "os"
// or use "node:" import specifiers here.
