# Phase 7 - AI Trading Strategy (Design)

This document defines the comprehensive architecture for the AI Trading Strategy, including how the LLM evaluates the market, scores individual equities, and continuously learns from its own outcomes.

## 2026-08-19 Gather must not inventory Pinecone or latch on 502/429

Same Roth `9d71dda4` terminal.  Robinhood `too many symbols (max 10, got 250)` at +18s remains the first hard fail (#2852 `c7b775c5`, folded in, not replaced).  The same window also listed/fetched the whole Pinecone index, 502'd congress.trade, and 429'd Massive.  There was no OpenRouter strategy/completion call — only run-scoped `usage_budget_status` at +10s, then the crash.  Gather retrieval stays query/id scoped.  `managed-vector-reconcile` and `inventoryVectorRecordsByMetadata` skip whole-index list/fetch while any strategy run/request is queued or running (account deletion still inventories).  Do not flip `RAG_PINECONE_WRITE_CLASS`.  Do not prune the live index.  Do not reopen #2840.  congress.trade 502 and Massive 429 fail-open so Green can start.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-gather-no-pinecone-inventory.md`.

## 2026-08-19 Robinhood quote chunk (250-name gather)

Live Roth `9d71dda4` reached gather, then Robinhood `get_equity_quotes` rejected `too many symbols (max 10, got 250)`.  That emptied the Robinhood quote pass, so a full-scan universe never priced through the broker and Green/`llm_usage` never started.  Requests are chunked to 10 symbols; the universe stays 250 (or the full scan).  A congress.trade HTTP 404 is a miss, not a latch on the free enrichment wave.  Drain handoff is merged (#2853 `df1f5a37`).  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-robinhood-quote-chunk.md`.

## 2026-08-19 Manual Run once drain handoff (claimed worker)

#2848 paused ROIC/FTS.  Live `c55c2e64` Roth `9d71dda4` still sat llm=0 after embed was already skipped, then sweep-failed 01:29:44Z `stalled_no_progress` (~31m, same process 00:51:39Z).  `POST /api/strategy/run` claims the durable request in a request-scoped `void` kick.  `processPendingStrategyRunRequests` then selected only `queued`, so `strategy-run-drain` journaled skipped on every tick (1372/1372, avg 8ms) while the run row stayed `running`.  Drain now heartbeats a live worker, resumes a claimed request with no heartbeat on the same run id (the 202 UUID Activity polls), and the route kicks again via `after()`.  Scan + quote cascade has an 8m deadline so gather cannot sit until the 30m sweep.  Pre-Green Alpaca positions/orders use the 16s+8s budget; the strategy snapshot has a 45s deadline.  Robinhood max-10 quote chunk is this PR (#2852).  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-manual-run-drain-handoff.md`.

## 2026-08-18 Manual Run once request/run status coupling

`POST /api/strategy/run` writes `strategy_run_requests` first, then `runStrategyOnce` uses that same UUID as `strategy_runs.id`.  `queueStrategyRunRequest` dedupes while any request for that user is `queued` or `running`.  `markStaleRunningRuns` used to fail only the `strategy_runs` row.  After #2845, ASC saw 0 new Roth `strategy_runs` after 22:06:43Z because orphan `0e5ccd66` was sweep-failed at 22:13:05Z (0 LLM) while its request stayed `running`.  The sweep and `finishStrategyRun` now close the matching open request.  The next scheduler tick and the next Manual Run once click both heal an already-terminal run whose request is still open.  Do not hide the lock by ignoring `running`.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-sweep-failed-request-lock.md`.

## 2026-08-18 getAccounts 6s abort + ROIC/FTS must not starve Green

Manual Run once fail-closes on `accountReadiness` when dashboard `getAccounts` / portfolio times out.  Same process `581467e1`: exact `gateway.getAccounts timed out after 6000ms — serving degraded snapshot` then `Failed to fetch accounts` (11 times); first wait is 16s on those broker reads.  After #2847 (`4abfb7fa`) Roth wrote `b3b83913` at 23:13:25Z but sat llm=0 ~17m with no gather/Green: `roic-transcript-refresh` since 23:11:45Z plus 78 `ftsMirrorSlice` 6–13s owned the loop.  FTS tick is 2s / 6 chunks / 1-row.  ROIC and FTS now skip or pause while any strategy run/request is queued or running, and the ROIC walk yields between periods.  The getAccount retry test mocks a short `alpacaAccountReadBudgetMs` so it can finish; live first wait stays 16s.  Stale-run sweep calls a run a restart only when `started_at` predates this process (`b3b83913` on the same `4abfb7fa` process was a stall, not a restart).  Do not reopen #2840.  Credential throws still fail immediately.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-getaccounts-loop-budget.md`.

## 2026-08-18 rag-embed DeepInfra batch window (ingest)

OpenRouter `baai/bge-m3` (DeepInfra) sums every string in one embed `input[]` against 8192 tokens.  A count-only batch of 32 ordinary chunks hit 8193 and 400'd `embed documents` after the 2026-08-18 2:12pm CT deploy.  That is a batch-sum, not one unchunked 10-K.  Hybrid still condenses first (`chunkDocument` 480 / `VECTOR_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS`); packing is only a batch-window fix after that step.  `storeContexts` packs already-condensed texts under ~7500 `approxTokens` and embeds each group on its own lane.  One over-limit condensed text is isolated as its own POST and cannot skip the companions.  Local store-more is unchanged.  `VECTOR_EMBED_BATCH_SIZE=32` in Infisical is safe.  The #2812 health gate, #2820 producer order, write-class, and #2800 fuse are unchanged.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-rag-embed-batch-window.md`.

## 2026-08-18 Green 400 must fail over to the next stored call

#2829 made 404/403 failover-eligible and stopped the account-miss liar.  It left HTTP 400 out.  Live Paper after that deploy (`7f5890a5-bc21-4474-87eb-9b595de04ed1`, sha `6429d984`): Green pick `gpt-5.6-terra` → `openai/gpt-5.6-terra`, OpenRouter 400 "Provider returned error", one `llm_call_latency`, then "Failover chain exhausted (3 Green Team endpoints)".  Red never ran.

`isFailoverLlmStatus` now includes 400 (same-model `isRetryableLlmStatus` still does not).  The exhausted suffix cites stored Green attempts only.  `gpt-5.6-terra` is demoted from first Green pick when Gemini Flash / Mistral Medium class seats remain; those seats lead implicit rotation fallbacks.  A 400 "Provider returned error" is not an account-allowlist miss.  Rebased onto `12e8dcd` (#2812 rag-embed soft-degrade kept).  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-green-400-failover.md`.

## 2026-08-18 Alpaca getAccount coalescing

Dashboard and strategy both `Promise.all` `getAccounts` + `getPortfolio`.  Each used to call Alpaca `GET /v2/account`, so the dashboard's 6s getAccounts deadline lost to a duplicate in-flight read (Roth IRA recoverable_issue storm).  REST `getAccount` is now in-flight coalesced and reused for 15s per connected account.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-prod-triage-alpaca-account-cache.md`.

## 2026-08-18 rag-embed soft-degrade (health + store)

A hard-stopped `rag-embed` / `rag-rerank` lane no longer 503s `/api/health`.  Coolify treats a 503 as container death; the restart re-halts autonomy via the boot interlock.  Those lanes now degrade like OpenRouter credits (`ok: false`, `degraded: true`, HTTP 200).  `pinecone` and `alpaca-broker` stay the only critical liveness deps.  One dead document-embed batch skips that batch and continues later batches; a thrown query embed returns empty retrieval.  Green/Red already skip RAG on lookup failure and do not halt.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-rag-embed-soft-degrade.md`.

## 2026-08-18 OpenRouter 404s are not "not on your account"

Coolify 2026-08-18 (sha `cda485ff`): today's Green 404s are valid public slugs `google/gemini-3.7-flash` (86ms) and `mistralai/mistral-medium-3-5` (82ms).  Claude/Grok/Kimi/mini-latest were skipped, not called — tilde restore does not clear today's fails.  Live #2771 set `require_parameters=true` on every OpenRouter body; that empties the endpoint set and 404s models that exist.  Strategy now omits `require_parameters` except the nano `max_completion_tokens` case.  Classifier: bare 404 / “No endpoints found matching your request” is not an account miss; `model_not_found` is a bad slug.  Secondary: dated / `~` wire ids for the skipped seats.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-openrouter-rotation-alias-failopen.md`.

## 2026-08-18 Pinecone store-more vs condense-first (report)

Green/Red consume 8/1 chunks and a 24k filings-family budget via `retrieveContextDetailed`.  More raw 10-K/Q/transcript vectors are not better for those decisions.  Operational path is **hybrid**: processed proposer corpus (extractive highlights + form-aware signal sections + speaker-turn slices; latest full call for high-interest names until transcript FTS exists) in Pinecone, full bodies in SQLite/artifacts.  Minimum writer split is landed; `RAG_PINECONE_WRITE_CLASS` still defaults to `full-body` until PR B hydrate exists — do not flip the env in this PR.  Live prune is junk/HTML/duplicate/low-value only; useful full-body vectors that are the only copy stay.  Builder is 10 GB / 5M WU with a hard cap.  Full argument: `docs/audits/2026-08-18-pinecone-store-vs-condense.md`.  Writer-split design: `docs/designs/2026-08-16-proposer-corpus-storage.md`.  Implementation: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-hybrid-and-prune.md`.

The rolling-24h write fuse must not treat local month-to-date WUs as Pinecone's bill.  That remainder clamp produced the 15-WU / 1-text skip (used 0, attempted 28) while the Standard trial still had credit.  Hybrid processed writes continue; do not raise a fake daily/monthly ceiling.  See `docs/rollouts/2026-08-17-pinecone-write-deadlock.md`.

## 2026-07-13 evidence-contract and learning-boundary update

The implemented decision path now treats evidence routing as a first-class contract:

- a wider cheap preselection is enriched before the final candidate rank;
- enriched fields carry availability, timestamp, provenance, disagreement, and provider-failure
  receipts while preserving scalar consumers;
- buy/short openings are deterministically limited to the exact final candidate set;
- Green and Red receive one content-addressed evidence manifest and the complete same evidence
  object, with a parity hash recorded in the run audit;
- SEC/RAG, learned prose, reflections, and episodic memories share one run-wide context budget and
  instruction-like external text is quarantined as data;
- realized and skipped outcomes join to decision-time source ablations, producing explicitly
  observational source-value telemetry; and
- structured lessons (`learned_context` + lesson vectors) are per-user and pool paper and live
  closed lots across the owner's connected accounts. There is no 20-paper+5-live transfer gate;
  paper trains live. The product Test Account is removed and purged.

See `docs/reviews/2026-07-13-decision-evidence-architecture.md` for the source-by-source audit,
invariants, and residual gaps.

## 2026-07-13 sizing-arithmetic and outcome-semantics update

- The app computes and persists finalized notional, decision-time NAV, order percentage of NAV,
  daily cap mode/effective dollars, used budget, and remaining budget before Red Team review.
- Migration v27 stores the exact Green rationale and sizing snapshot on the durable Socratic case;
  refreshes and later coach/outcome/lesson writes preserve both receipts.
- Red Team receives those deterministic values as authoritative arithmetic, so prose such as
  "$4 is 0.04% of a $100 account" cannot be treated as a model-derived fact.
- A Red approval means only that the adversarial thesis review approved the stated size; policy,
  broker preflight, and placement remain separate deterministic outcomes in data and UI.
- A Red rejection is called overridden only when the final policy decision records an applied
  override; the earlier model request is not proof that hard gates allowed it.
- Override-request audits likewise say `red_team_veto_override_requested`; the existing
  `socratic_override_applied`/`socratic_override_refused` events remain final-outcome truth, while
  historical `red_team_veto_overridden` rows remain readable for longitudinal metrics.
- Alpaca sub-share dollar entries clear whole-share bracket fields when the app declares the native
  bracket skipped, preventing the receipt/transport contradiction that previously blocked EXE.

## 2026-07-14 final-size and lifecycle invariant update

- A successful broker-minimum bump on a risk-adding opening refreshes the exact sizing receipt and
  reruns Red once on Green-only prose plus structured evidence. Red's half-size result may apply one
  down-only haircut; the broker reviews that haircut, and the strategy never bumps it back up.
- Reject, unavailable, or broker-unplaceable half-size results hold the final broker-adjusted order
  for one explicit owner decision. That second approval is stamped and audited as an override
  without recursively rerunning Red. Risk-reducing exits remain exempt.
- That owner decision is scoped to the broker estimate shown on the pending card. Downward drift
  and upward quote noise no greater than the larger of 1%/$0.01 remain inside the approved risk
  envelope; a larger upward requote persists the new amount and requires one fresh click.
- Sell-to-fund planning cannot run ahead of that decision. Every otherwise autonomous opening is
  correlation-gated, broker-reviewed, minimum-adjusted, exact-size Red-reviewed, and
  policy/override-preflighted before its notional can request a funding sale. Correlation-dropped,
  broker-unplaceable, human-held, and non-funding policy-blocked openings contribute zero demand;
  the intended cumulative buying-power shortfall remains fundable. Placement consumes the cached
  exact broker shape rather than rerunning a review that could create a post-sale hold.
- Human-review reasons are independent. A later Red approval clears only the superseded Red hold,
  never rationale-collapse or owner-preference holds.
- Before any autonomous broker submission, the durable `trade_proposals` intent and initial
  `socratic_decisions` case commit in one SQLite transaction. Subsequent placement, broker decline,
  expiry, withdrawal, and recovery transitions update both ledgers transactionally.
- Human approval uses the same invariant: the atomic `proposed -> placing` claim requires a
  proposed Socratic case, creates a legacy fallback case inside that transaction when necessary,
  and fails before the broker boundary when the receipt cannot be committed.
- Uncertain submissions remain `placing` until reconciliation proves the result. Same-decision
  vector-memory writes are serialized and re-read current SQLite state before embedding, preventing
  a slow older lifecycle write from overwriting a newer terminal result.
- A synchronous broker fill remains `filled` end to end while still consuming daily/hourly limits
  and placement counts. Outcome coverage, run summaries, ops diagnostics, and the decision-memory
  lifecycle include it rather than dropping the most useful realized cases.
- A chat draft's synthetic run id is permanent idempotency, not merely pending-card dedupe. Retries
  after approval or fill return the original proposal, and the final lookup plus insert share an
  immediate SQLite transaction so concurrent requests cannot create a second approvable order.
- Crash recovery uses `(proposalId, brokerOrderId)` to prevent duplicate fill rows, but still
  reconciles the existing row forward. Broker-filled truth atomically advances a pending receipt,
  proposal, and Socratic case before the uncertainty notification is resolved.
- Terminal broker state is never interpreted without quantity: canceled/rejected/expired with a
  positive broker-filled quantity is a final partial execution. Direct placement stores the fill
  receipt before advancing proposal/case lifecycle in one transaction; persistence failure or a
  nonterminal response lacking an order id stays `placing` under refId recovery.
- A live `partially_filled` receipt is already accounting exposure and updates in place. Stale-limit
  replacement receipts dedupe on user + account + replacement identity, not globally on a broker id.
- Broker execution is not accounting truth until both cumulative quantity and a finite positive
  realized price are known. Unpriced receipts persist zero price/notional plus the maximum
  broker-reported quantity; later stale or terminal-zero snapshots cannot reduce that floor.
- A replacement partial missing price or order id remains active under its durable replacement ref,
  binds the eventual broker id onto the same receipt, and leaves recovery only after its known
  execution is priced. The active replacement lock is scoped by user + account + original order.

## 1. Strategy Architecture: Evaluation Lenses

To ensure balanced and resilient trade proposals, the LLM evaluates candidates
across macro, fundamental, technical, sentiment/news, alternative-data, and
adversarial-debate lenses before making a decision.

### A. Macro, Thematic, & Market Context
*Don't fight the Fed, and don't fight the broader trend.*
- **Core Macro Indicators:** SPY/QQQ daily trends, `^VIX` (Volatility Index), Fed Funds Rate trajectory, CPI/Inflation trends, Unemployment data, and broad market breadth (advancers vs. decliners).
  - *Implementation Target:* Integrate `VIXCLS` via the FRED API (already available in `macro.ts`) to immediately unlock "de-risk in high-vol regimes" logic.
- **Thematic & Structural Shifts:** Tracking long-term disruptive trends that create secular tailwinds or headwinds across entire sectors (e.g., GLP-1 weight loss drug adoption impacting not just food/healthcare, but downstream retail, clothing, and cosmetics sectors; AI infrastructure spending; housing/cost of living trends; and shifting consumer habits).
- **Goal:** Establish the risk regime. In a high-VIX or downtrending market, the strategy should naturally demand higher conviction for long positions, pivot to defensive sectors, or seek opportunistic **short** setups.

### B. Fundamental Factors
*Ensure underlying business health and value.*
- **Indicators:** Forward P/E Ratio vs. Sector Average, EPS Growth (QoQ/YoY), Free Cash Flow yield, Debt-to-Equity ratio, and forward guidance sentiment.
  - *Implementation Target:* Leverage SEC EDGAR (free, authoritative) for XBRL financials and 8-K filings, and explore Twelve Data or Tiingo for enhanced fundamental indicators.
- **Goal:** Identify structurally sound companies that are mispriced relative to their earnings potential for long positions, or conversely, identify fundamentally deteriorating companies (e.g., shrinking margins, high debt) as prime **short** candidates.

### C. Technical Factors
*Optimize entry and exit timing.*
- **Indicators:** Moving Averages (50-day and 200-day alignment), RSI (detecting extreme overbought > 70 or oversold < 30 conditions), MACD crossovers, Support/Resistance zones, and anomalous Volume spikes.
- **Goal:** Prevent buying "value traps" that are in a freefall, avoid chasing fundamentally strong stocks that are dangerously overextended, and optimally time entries for **short** positions (e.g., shorting at strong resistance or breakdown confirmations).

### D. Sentiment & News Catalysts
*Identify short-term directional fuel.*
- **Indicators:** Real-time company-specific headlines, earnings call sentiment (derived from NLP), sector-level news, and macro shock events.
  - *Implementation Target:* Upgrade the current keyword-heuristic sentiment scorer to a real ML model. Prioritize **Alpha Vantage NEWS_SENTIMENT** (drop-in API, utilizing our existing key) or score existing Finnhub headlines via a local **FinBERT** model. Use zero-key RSS feeds (Yahoo Finance, Google News) for broad catalyst capture.
- **Goal:** Anticipate sudden price re-ratings driven by external events that technicals and fundamentals have not yet priced in.

### E. Alternative Data & Alpha
*Gain an informational edge over retail consensus.*
- **Indicators:** Insider trading ratios (Form 4), Congressional trading activity, Unusual Options Activity (UOA) / Dark Pool prints, and NLP summarization of raw SEC EDGAR filings (8-K Material Events, 10-Q Risk Factors).
  - *Implementation Target:* Prioritize **FMP's senate and insider endpoints** (since the FMP key is already integrated) as the most cost-effective path to smart-money signals. Add SEC EDGAR RSS for authoritative Form 4 insider trades.
  - *(Note: We will integrate the Quiver Quantitative API in the short-term future to specifically source high-quality Congressional trading and lobbying data).*
- **Legislative & Litigation Risk:** Actively monitoring for pending lawsuits, anti-trust actions, or major legislative changes (e.g., subsidies, new tariffs, regulatory approvals) that could drastically re-rate a company's valuation overnight.
- **Token Efficiency Mechanism:** Raw filings and options chains are *never* fed directly to the active prompt. An asynchronous background task digests these alternative data streams and produces 1-sentence bulletins (e.g., *"Insider buying detected at 52-week lows; 8-K shows new DoD contract"*).
- **Goal:** Uncover hidden risks or catalysts before they hit mainstream financial news headlines.

### F. Multi-Agent "Bull vs. Bear" Debate
*Prevent confirmation bias and hallucination.*
- **Mechanism:** Before a high-conviction trade is finalized, the proposal is routed to a separate "Red Team / Bear" prompt. This prompt is tasked *exclusively* with finding reasons the trade will fail (e.g., hidden technical resistance, negative sector news, overvaluation).
- **Goal:** The main agent must successfully address or invalidate the Bear agent's concerns before the trade is approved, ensuring maximum robustness and quality.
- **Implementation status (2026-07-01, Audit Chat A):** the inline Bear critique inside
  `proposeTrades` now **fails CLOSED** — if it can't run (missing key, transport
  error/timeout, unparseable response) the un-critiqued Bull proposals are routed to
  human review in `decide` mode instead of auto-executing (never a silent carry-forward),
  with a loud audit + `provider_degraded` notification. The Bull/Bear system prompts are
  extracted to the versioned leaf module `src/lib/strategy-prompts.ts`
  (`STRATEGY_PROMPT_VERSION` + `buildBullSystem`/`buildBearSystem`), stamped onto every
  proposal via `trade_proposals.prompt_version`, and covered by a deterministic offline
  eval (`npm run eval:strategy-offline`). The per-proposal `debateProposal` red-team now
  requests strict `json_schema` on OpenAI-compatible providers, and the strategy/red-team
  Anthropic calls use prompt caching. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-01-strategy-llm-money-path.md`.
- **Single-adversary consolidation (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-07):** `docs/single-adversary-consolidation.md`
  landed, as amended by the owner's 2026-07-07 revision. The in-flow Bear LLM pass inside
  `proposeTrades` is DELETED (the model-free `deterministicBearFilter` stays); the single hardened
  **Red Team** (`debateProposal`) reviews the finalized (post-sizing) trade for EVERY risk-adding
  opening (universal coverage, concurrent with a 3-wide pool), fact-checks the strategist's claims
  against the same candidate evidence the Bull saw (R7 `adversaryContext`), returns a discrete
  down-only `approve`/`approve-at-half`/`reject` verdict (unplaceable half → held for human, never
  up-sized), fails **closed and visibly** when it can't run (persisted `decision.adversaryUnavailable`
  + notification flag + amber approval-card badge), and NEVER reviews exits or net-risk-reducing
  trades (§3.5, net-direction-aware). NO MODEL DEFAULTS anywhere: both `llmModel` and
  `redTeamLlmModel` are mandatory explicit Settings picks (keyed providers only; same model allowed
  with a non-blocking independence hint); the `RED_TEAM_LLM_PROVIDER`/`RED_TEAM_LLM_MODEL` env
  override is deleted (db migration v15 seeds the first-class setting once from a live override).
  Reliability: `extractJsonPayload` fence-tolerant parsing at every LLM parse site incl. the Bull,
  strict shape validation (unknown verdict = fail closed), bounded same-model retry
  (`fetchLlmWithRetry`, no hidden failover). Prompt version bumped to `agentic-strategy@2.0.0`.
  See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-07-single-adversary-consolidation-impl.md`.
- **First-class verdict (2026-07-01):** the Red Team debate result is stored on the proposal as a
  structured `redTeamVerdict?: { rejected; available; reason }` field (`TradeProposal` in
  `src/lib/types.ts`), not just appended to the free-text rationale. It survives the JSON round-trip
  into `trade_proposals` (folded into the existing payload column — no migration), so the dashboard
  can render a dedicated "Bear Review" block instead of burying the critique in a truncated
  rationale. The backward-compat rationale-append text is preserved.
- **Bear-veto audit (2026-07-01):** a Bear *rejection* now writes an
  `audit("proposal_rejected_by_red_team", { symbol, side, thesisTag, reason })` row before the
  proposal is dropped — parity with the sibling `proposal_skipped_negative_ev` /
  `proposal_skipped_correlation` audits — so a vetoed high-conviction trade is visible in the
  Activity/Audit feed rather than only in the server console.
- **Bear-veto counterfactuals + efficacy scorecard (2026-07-04):** the audit event above is now
  additionally stamped with `runId` and `model`, and the Bear-reject branch calls
  `recordRejectedProposalCounterfactual` for opening (buy/short) proposals — the same
  counterfactual pipeline policy blocks and human rejections already feed — so a vetoed
  high-conviction trade's post-veto return matures into missed-opportunity analytics. New
  `getRedTeamEfficacy()` (`src/lib/performance.ts`) joins the audit events to matured
  counterfactual rows (via `runId+symbol`) and reports rejection rate, veto value-add (the vetoed
  trade lost money — the Bear helped), survivor-risk hit rate (the vetoed trade won — the Bear
  missed it), and a per-model breakdown. Advisory/read-only; API/db-level only — no console/Results
  UI wiring yet (see `docs/rollouts/2026-07-04-w1-learning-loops.md`).
- **The Outcome Engine (2026-07-04, Wave 2):** loop step 5 is no longer a stub —
  `src/lib/outcome-engine.ts` (`matureSocraticDecisionOutcomes`, fired on the counterfactual
  cadence from `strategy.ts`) writes `SocraticDecisionCase.outcome`: placed decisions join their
  `fill_events` entry and realized FIFO closed-lot P&L; blocked/rejected decisions (incl. Bear
  vetoes) join their counterfactual `refPrice`. Outcomes are MULTI-HORIZON —
  `outcomes[] {15m|1h|1d|1w, returnPct, spyExcessPct, priceBasis, resolution}` (pure math in
  `src/lib/outcome-horizons.ts`, trading-day arithmetic) — on decision cases and on
  skipped-counterfactual rows. 1d/1w come from daily closes via the cascade, SPY-relative;
  15m/1h resolve only from an actually-sampled live quote, else land honestly as
  `unresolvable(no_intraday_source)`. Kill-survivorship: a symbol whose series never resolves
  within a bounded 10-trading-day recheck window terminates `unresolvable` (with reason) and
  stays in every denominator — coverage disclosures ("N/M resolved (X%)") ride on job receipts,
  `getRedTeamEfficacy`, the missed-opportunity summary, and `certifyForwardResolution`. On case
  closure a budget-gated, batch-capped LLM post-mortem replaces the template `lessons[]` with
  1-3 direction-tagged lessons (+`verdictOnBelief`/`whichDissentMattered`), re-indexes the case
  vector, and routes each lesson through `ingestLearned` (origin `autonomous`); every skip is
  receipted. See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-04-w2-outcome-engine.md`.
- **Durable due-jobs substrate for 15m/1h sampling (2026-07-05):** the 15m/1h sample no longer
  depends on a `runStrategyOnce` cadence run coincidentally landing inside the tolerance window. A
  generic claimable job queue (`due_jobs` table, `src/lib/db-jobs.ts`, lease/reclaim so a crashed
  claim is never stuck) is enqueued the moment a case's entry basis (fill or ref price) is known;
  `outcome-engine.ts`'s `drainDueIntradaySampleJobs` worker (called from `scheduler.ts`'s `tick()`)
  drains due jobs, samples a live quote, and writes through the exact same
  `mergeHorizonRows`/write path the inline sampling uses — so whichever side resolves a horizon
  first wins and the other is a documented no-op, never a duplicate row. The inline sampling path
  described above is unchanged and still runs; this is additive redundancy, not a replacement. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-05-durable-due-jobs.md`.

## 2. Initial Factor Weighting Matrix

When initially deployed (or for new Strategy Profiles), the system uses a default scoring matrix to blend the core deterministic factor scores. The LLM sees these scores plus source evidence and scales its confidence around them rather than replacing deterministic policy gates.

**Baseline Default Weights:**
- **Fundamentals (Value/Growth): 30%** (Anchor the portfolio in real business health)
- **Macro/Regime Alignment: 25%** (Respect the broader market environment)
- **Technicals (Timing/Momentum): 25%** (Ensure optimal entry execution)
- **News/Sentiment (Catalysts): 20%** (Capture short-term momentum triggers)

*Note: The strategy is designed to allow these weights to be dynamic. They serve as a starting point, but the system will actively recommend tuning them based on actual performance.*

## 3. The Auto-Tuning Engine (The Learning Loop)

The most critical component of the AI strategy is its ability to remember past trades, evaluate its own decisions, and suggest improvements. This forms the "Auto-Tuning Engine".

### A. Context Snapshots & Execution Metrics
Every executed trade records a comprehensive `StrategyOutcome` that goes far beyond simple P&L.
- **Execution Realism:** The learning loop explicitly penalizes the LLM for slippage and transaction costs. The system logs gross vs. net performance, forcing the LLM to learn the "cost of doing business" and favoring higher-conviction setups over rapid, unprofitable scalping.
- **Context Snapshots:** The system logs `entryMarketRegime` and `exitMarketRegime` (e.g., exact VIX and SPY trend at the time of the trade). This allows the LLM to learn context-specific rules (e.g., "My momentum trades fail when VIX > 25").
- **MAE & MFE:** The system calculates Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE) and Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE) during the holding period. This teaches the LLM about its timing: Is it cutting winners too early? Is it holding losers too long through massive drawdowns?
- **Trade Thesis Classification:** The LLM must tag its initial proposal with a `tradeThesisTag` (e.g., *Mean Reversion*, *Breakout*, *Value Play*, *Earnings Catalyst*). 

```ts
export interface StrategyOutcome {
  proposalId?: string;
  runId?: string;
  accountNumber: string;
  source: "paper" | "live";
  symbol: string;
  side: "buy" | "sell" | "short" | "cover";
  rationale: string;
  entryPrice?: number;
  entryAt?: string;
  exitPrice?: number;
  exitAt?: string;
  currentPrice?: number;
  realizedPnl?: number;
  unrealizedPnl?: number;
  returnPct?: number;
  holdingDays?: number;
  sector?: string;
  tradeThesisTag?: string; // e.g., Mean Reversion, Breakout, Value
  riskExit?: "stop_loss" | "take_profit" | "trailing_stop";
  entryMarketRegime?: any; // Snapshot of SPY, QQQ, VIX at entry
  exitMarketRegime?: any; // Snapshot of SPY, QQQ, VIX at exit
  mae?: number; // Maximum Adverse Excursion during holding
  mfe?: number; // Maximum Favorable Excursion during holding
}
```

### C. Risk Management & Short Selling Guardrails
While the strategy evaluates trades across the strategy lenses, it must also respect absolute risk parameters, especially given the infinite risk profile of short selling.
- **Short Selling Risk Cap:** Short positions must be heavily scrutinized. The maximum allowable portfolio allocation for any single short position will be strictly capped (e.g., lower than long positions).
- **Hard Stop-Losses:** Any short proposal must carry an absolute, non-negotiable stop-loss logic (e.g., max 5% adverse excursion) to prevent runaway losses.

### C.1 Pending-Proposal Staleness (Expiry + On-Run Re-Validation)
Proposals stay in the approval queue until a human approves or rejects them, so an old one can keep looking like a current recommendation. Two mechanisms keep the queue honest (`src/lib/proposal-revalidation.ts`):

1. **Deterministic hard expiry** — `policy.proposalExpiryMinutes` (default 2880 = 2 days; 0 = Never). A pending proposal older than the TTL is moved to status `expired` with an audit event, a `proposal_withdrawn` notification, and an SSE refresh. It runs at the **start of every strategy run** and on **every scheduler tick** (even while halted or the market is closed), so the queue self-clears regardless of run cadence. UI: a dropdown (3h / 6h / 12h / 1d / 2d / 5d / 10d / Never).
2. **On-run LLM re-validation, cadence-gated to market hours** — `policy.proposalRevalidateCadenceHours` (default 0 = every run). It is not optional (no on/off switch) — it rides on strategy runs. Inside `runStrategyOnce`, each still-pending proposal that is **due** (≥ cadence hours since it was created or last re-checked; 0 = always) is re-checked against the fresh scan + current regime in one batched LLM call ("does this still stand?"). It runs **only during the regular US session** (`currentMarketSession === "regular"`), so it never re-checks overnight — re-checking when nothing can be acted on is wasted work and the scan would be stale. `reaffirm` stamps `last_revalidated_at` (the dashboard then shows "Re-checked X ago — still advised" and the staleness clock resets); `withdraw` moves it to status `withdrawn`. Ambiguous/missing output defaults to *keep*; the pass is skipped (deterministic expiry still applies) when the market is closed, `OPENAI_API_KEY` is absent, or the call fails. UI: a dropdown (Every run / Once per day / Every 5 days).

### C.2 Opening Size and Broker Bracket Practicality

The LLM advises proposal size, but deterministic sizing remains authoritative.
`limits.maxOrderNotional` in the prompt is the absolute cap after combining
absolute and percent-of-NAV policy settings; `limits.preferredMaxOrderNotional`
is the normal opening-size target after reserving a 5% execution buffer below
that cap. Hidden stale values must not bind behind the user's visible risk
control, and proposals should not sit exactly on the hard policy tripwire. The
policy gate also enforces this opening-order buffer, so a `$4.99` max order cap
allows a preferred opening size up to `$4.74`; larger orders are blocked with a
reason telling the user to reduce size or raise the policy cap. For Alpaca
REST/MCP native brackets, a dollar order needs enough notional to represent at
least one whole share at the reference price. If the advised notional is below
that threshold and policy capacity allows it, the deterministic pass raises the
order to one-share notional and records the reason. If the cap does not allow a
full share, the proposal may remain a fractional dollar order, but native Alpaca
bracket legs are skipped so the broker is not asked for an impossible sub-share
bracket.

As of 2026-06-28, `TradeProposal.referencePrice` is explicitly the decision-time
market quote used for entry-drift checks and proposal/counterfactual performance
readouts. A limit or stop entry may be different; bracket legs and Alpaca
whole-share bracket feasibility use the intended entry price (`limitPrice` /
`stopPrice` / market anchor fallback) so a below-market limit order does not
make a fresh proposal look as though it already gained versus its market anchor.

### C.3 Broker-Held Exit Availability

Before any broker-backed sell or cover reaches order placement, the strategy
subtracts active broker-held exit orders from the current position quantity. This
guards against duplicate exits when a prior bracket/OCO leg, stop, take-profit,
or pending manual sell already reserves the same shares at the broker. If the
requested exit exceeds the remaining broker-available quantity, the proposal is
blocked with a normal policy-style reason instead of being sent to the broker and
surfacing as an uncertain placement failure.

The guard is intentionally pre-submit and fail-closed: it does not silently clamp
the exit quantity. The user must cancel or replace the existing broker order if a
different exit is desired.

### C.4 Broker Order Lifecycle and Stale Limit Alerts

Broker-backed order acceptance is not execution. The app keeps the existing
proposal status value `placed` for compatibility, but user-facing surfaces render
that state as `Submitted` / `Working` until either the broker order state or fill
reconciliation confirms execution. `filled` fill events remain the accounting
truth for P&L and portfolio projection. Broker-paper pending reconciliation rows
are excluded from paper accounting until a broker fill is observed; legacy
Test/local simulated fills remain accounting-valid.
If the broker reports an order as filled before the local fill row reconciles,
the UI still treats the group as Working/pending reconciliation. Local `filled`
events remain the accounting and completed-trade truth.

The scheduler reconciles pending broker fills for both `broker/paper` and
`broker/live` accounts. It also checks broker-backed limit and stop-limit orders
against `policy.staleLimitOrderMinutes` (default 15, 0 disables). A working order
older than the threshold emits one deduped `limit_order_stale` audit/notification
per order and threshold, so the operator can decide whether to cancel, reprice,
or intentionally replace it with a market order.

Activity exposes a guarded `Market replace` action for stale working limit and
stop-limit orders. The server cancels the original order, waits briefly, re-reads
broker order state, and submits a market order only for the remaining quantity
once the original is no longer active. For `broker/live`, the operator must type
`REPLACE LIVE <SYMBOL>` and the confirmation must match the selected account,
order id, execution mode, and remaining quantity before the cancel request is
sent.

### D. Token Efficiency & Asynchronous Post-Mortems
Feeding dozens of raw rationales, P&L lines, and redundant daily news into the trading prompt wastes massive amounts of tokens and degrades LLM reasoning. To optimize this:

1. **Information-Theoretic Pruning (Tiered Memory):** The system feeds the LLM only *delta* (change) information. If the Fed Funds rate or broader macro context hasn't changed since yesterday, it is excluded. Short-term memory (daily headlines) decays quickly, while long-term memory (quarterly reports) is compressed.
2. **Asynchronous Reflection:** A background task (e.g., nightly or weekly) analyzes recently closed trades against their original `tradeThesisTag` and `entryMarketRegime`.
3. **Prompt Auto-Pruning (OPRO):** During this reflection, the LLM generates a highly condensed **Reflection Summary** (e.g., *"Lesson: Tech breakouts failing due to choppy VIX"*). Furthermore, it actively rewrites and prunes its own prompt instructions, dropping rules that are no longer relevant to the current market regime to save tokens.
4. **Injection:** Only this concise "Lessons Learned" block and the auto-pruned instructions are injected into the active trading prompt, providing high-signal feedback at a fraction of the token cost.

**Implemented (2026-06-16):**
- **Outcome-aware Thesis Scorecard** — `getThesisScorecard()` (`performance.ts`)
  computes realized win rate / avg return / total P&L per `tradeThesisTag` from
  closed lots (deterministic, zero tokens) and injects it as
  `tradeOutcomesByThesis` into both the Bull prompt (with an instruction to
  favor proven theses and avoid repeat losers) and the post-mortem reflection,
  so the reflection is grounded in what actually made/lost money rather than
  trade descriptions alone.
- **Gated reflection** — `generateReflectionSummary` only regenerates when the
  trade history changed (signature = `#filledTrades:latestFillTime`), instead of
  every run. This saves an LLM call on no-fill runs and keeps the Bull
  system-prompt prefix stable so provider prompt-caching can hit.
- **Bounded LLM requests (2026-06-20)** — Bull, Bear, Red Team, strategy-tuning,
  and post-mortem calls now use shared OpenAI request bounds with deterministic
  temperature and explicit output caps. Their prompts and payloads use
  `broker/paper` and `broker/live` wording so broker-hosted paper fills are
  never confused with real-capital fills.
- **Green Team empty/malformed failover + credits hint (2026-08-17, #2577)** —
  Green Team is the Bull proposer.  Empty HTTP-200 content already failed over
  along `llmFallbackModels` (2026-07-31).  A malformed HTTP-200 JSON body now
  fails over the same way (`strategy_llm_failover` reason `malformed_response`).
  A rotating Green seat with no owner fallbacks appends two other eligible pool
  models so a single glitching pick cannot kill the run.  When the cached
  OpenRouter credits check is below threshold, the strategy `run_failed`
  notification (and run summary) adds a distinct "credits look exhausted" hint
  — empty responses are the observed symptom of a near-zero prepaid balance.
- **LLM step timeout diagnostics (2026-06-30)** — strategy runs now audit
  `llm_step` start/failure rows and preserve failed Green Team context in the
  final `strategy_run` audit. Raw abort strings are translated into
  provider/model-specific guidance (for example, Green Team `gpt-5.5` high
  reasoning timing out after the shared 60s cap), while Red Team transport
  failures fallback to Bull proposals with an auditable reason. Interactive
  strategy runs keep the 60s cap: `gpt-5.5` with high reasoning is rejected in
  Settings and stale stored configs are clamped to medium effort at request
  build time.
- **Context trimming** — large allowlists (e.g. full S&P 500) are sent as a
  compact note instead of every ticker; `recentOrders` is slimmed to 8 records;
  the Bear/critique agent receives only the candidates under review rather than
  a second full copy of the market scan.
- **Regime-conditioned outcomes** — `getRegimeScorecard()` groups realized
  outcomes by `entryMarketRegime`; `tradeOutcomesByRegime` is fed to the Bull
  (compare today's regime to history), Bear, and reflection.
- **MAE/MFE excursion lessons** — `getExcursionsByThesis()` (replacing the old
  `runPostMortems` stub) aggregates holding-period adverse/favorable excursions
  and capture-of-favorable-move per thesis, computed only in the gated async
  post-mortem so the proposal path stays network-free.
- **Delta-only macro pruning** — `pruneMacro()` sends only changed (plus
  regime-critical) macro fields on repeat runs, listing the rest as unchanged.
- **Risk-control wiring audit + money-path test (2026-07-01, audit work-split F/G):**
  - **Drawdown kill-switch (G5)** — verified `runStrategyOnce` (`src/lib/strategy.ts:~253-262`)
    flips an `active`, autonomous run to `close_only` via `setPolicy`, audits
    `policy_violation_drawdown`, and sends a `kill_switch` notification when the account draws down
    past `riskRules.maxDrawdownPct` / `maxDailyLossNotional` from the persisted equity high-water
    mark (HWM + start-of-day equity live in the settings KV, so they survive a restart). Already
    wired and durable; the missing piece was a *regression test* driving the full
    breach→`close_only` flip through `runStrategyOnce`
    (`test/strategy-moneypath-drawdown-flip.test.ts`). Default-safe: the block is gated on `active`
    and no-ops when no limit is configured; no behavior change.
  - **Correlation cluster gate (G6)** — verified `applyCorrelationClusterGate`
    (`src/lib/strategy.ts:~1087`, invoked at `~509`) runs *before* execution, keyed on
    `policy.maxAvgCorrelation` (default off). An over-correlated *opening* buy/short is dropped with
    an `audit("proposal_skipped_correlation")` row while exits (sell/cover) always pass. Built +
    wired + opt-in; covered by `test/correlation-cluster-gate.test.ts`.
  - **Money-path e2e test (G7)** — `test/strategy-money-path-f-g.test.ts` drives `runStrategyOnce`
    in broker/paper mode (simulated fills via the `TestBrokerGateway` test-infrastructure adapter,
    never a real trade) with a stubbed LLM and asserts the full proposal→evaluate→execute path
    books a paper fill and persists a proposal + `fill_event`.
  - **Live-order pre-flight guard (G7)** — `src/lib/preflight-live-guard.ts` (`assertLivePreflight`)
    is a default-SAFE assertion wired in just before a real (`broker/live`) order is placed
    (`src/lib/strategy.ts`, before `gateway.placeEquityOrder`). `LivePreflightInput.mode` is one of
    `"broker/paper" | "broker/live"`; the guard is a hard no-op whenever `mode !== "broker/live"`
    (i.e. any broker/paper run — there is no separate local Test mode). On the real-capital path
    it throws (blocking the order + auditing `order_blocked_live_preflight`) unless live trading
    is explicitly enabled via the `ALLOW_LIVE_TRADING=true` env flag (or the caller passes
    `allowLive: true`). It never places or enables a trade. Unit-tested in
    `test/preflight-live-guard.test.ts`.
- **Observability prompt-version + decision stamps (2026-07-01, G10):** every traced strategy
  generation (bull `trading.strategy.bull`, bear `trading.strategy.bear`, red-team
  `trading.red-team.debate`) now carries `metadata.promptVersion`, sourced from the single
  `STRATEGY_PROMPT_VERSION` constant (`src/lib/strategy.ts`) so traces are filterable/comparable
  across prompt revisions. The **Bear-veto** count is stamped into the bear generation's output
  (`bearVeto` / `bearVetoCount`), and a **rationale diversity-collapse** emits a stamped
  `recordDecisionObservation("trading.strategy.diversity-collapse")` span
  (`src/lib/observability.ts`). All of it is a hard no-op when Langfuse is unconfigured
  (`langfuseConfigured()` gates it). Covered by `test/redteam-observability-g10.test.ts`.
- Still TODO from this section: OPRO-style prompt self-rewrite (intentionally
  kept advisory-only via Strategy Studio's human-approved tuning, not
  auto-applied).
- **MAE/MFE persistence IS implemented**: `db-fills.ts` exposes
  `persistMaeMfeById` and `persistMaeMfeByKey` which update `fill_events.mae`
  and `fill_events.mfe` columns (added via migration in `db.ts`). The excursion
  computation path in the gated post-mortem writes these via the persistence
  helpers; earlier reflection cycles that recomputed without persisting are
  superseded.

**Implemented (2026-06-16, signals + learning pass — branch `ui-redesign`):**
This pass implemented the tractable subset of Codex's "Stronger Trading Signals
And Learning Loop" research plan, honoring its directive to *finish plumbing
existing fields end-to-end before adding new providers*.
- **Pillar-B/E fields plumbed end-to-end.** `fcfYield`, `debtToEquity`, and
  `epsGrowth` (Pillar B, section 1.B) now feed `valueScore`/`qualityScore`
  (`market.ts`); `insiderSentiment` and `senateTrades` (Pillar E, section 1.E)
  plus the three fundamentals are now emitted per candidate by
  `compactMarketScanForPrompt` and shown in the Market Scan table (FCF% / D/E /
  EPS gr columns). These fields were already fetched through the enrichment
  cascade but dead-ended before reaching scoring/prompt/UI.
- **Fixed thesis playbook** (replaces the free-form `tradeThesisTag`).
  `THESIS_PLAYBOOK` (10 tags) now constrains both the Bull and Bear JSON schemas
  (`enum`), so the thesis x outcome scorecards bucket consistently and can
  accumulate learnable samples. The proactive risk-exit tag is now `"Risk-Exit"`.
- **Bayesian shrinkage on the scorecards** (section 3.E small-sample guardrail).
  `aggregateClosedLots` adds `shrunkWinRate`/`shrunkAvgReturnPct` (neutral
  50%/0% prior, 5-trade pseudo-count); the Bull prompt instructs the agent to
  prefer the shrunk rates when `trades` is small. This is a prerequisite for the
  section 3.E "minimum 20 outcomes" gate to behave sanely on partial samples.
- **Counterfactual candidate log** (raw material for section 3 learning).
  `runStrategyOnce` writes a `candidates_considered` audit event per run: what
  the agent chose (symbol/side/status/thesisTag) vs the top-8 skipped scan
  candidates by score, without fabricating fills for un-traded names.
**Implemented (2026-06-16, web-sources pass — branch `web-sources`, see
`docs/phase-9-web-sources.md`):**
- **EvidenceDigest / SignalSnapshot** (section 1.E "Token Efficiency Mechanism").
  Backend connectors digest congressional disclosures (Senate eFD + Capitol
  Trades) and SEC EDGAR Form 4 insider trades into 1-line `smartMoneyEvidence`
  bulletins fed to the prompt — raw rows stay out. `runStrategyOnce` also writes a
  `signal_snapshot` audit per run (per-symbol factor sub-scores + congress/insider
  net + bulletins + thesis × regime) so outcomes can later be correlated with the
  signals that preceded them.
- **Multi-dimensional learning** (section 3): `getThesisRegimeScorecard()` crosses
  thesis × regime (shrunk like the 1-D cards) and feeds `tradeOutcomesByThesisRegime`
  to the agent. Phase 10 later added sector-on-fills and `getSectorScorecard()`;
  the fully composite thesis × regime × sector × factor view is still a follow-up.
- **20-outcome guardrail** (section 3.E): `MIN_CLOSED_LOTS_FOR_WEIGHT_SHIFT = 20`
  now gates the auto-tuner — factor-weight changes are withheld (local-rules path
  emits no weight patch; LLM path is instructed to null all weights) until ≥20 lots
  have closed.
- **New providers**: congressional (Senate eFD / Capitol Trades) and SEC EDGAR
  Form 4 insider are live as backend web-sources (the user's FMP key is
  rate-limited, so those FMP senate/insider paths returned nothing).
- Later Phase 10 work added SEC 8-K bulletins, FINRA short-volume, market breadth,
  technical signals, Fama-French factors, Cboe SKEW/VVIX, CFTC COT, and sector
  learning. Still deferred: House congressional coverage when a stable free feed is
  available, weight shifts wired into *sizing* (currently advisory via Strategy
  Studio), richer per-filing document digests, and factor-bucket learning.

### E. Human-Approved Weight Shifting
The ultimate expression of the learning loop is adjusting the Initial Factor Weighting Matrix and Sector Allocations.

- The system generates advisory suggestions that analyze outcome performance across factor scores, `tradeThesisTag`, market regime, and industry sectors.
- **Dynamic Factor Weight Shifting:** If the Post-Mortem reveals that trades heavily weighted by "Fundamentals" are losing money in a speculative market, but "Technicals" are winning, the system will suggest a policy patch: *"Decrease Fundamental Weight by 5%, Increase Technical Weight by 5%."*
- **Dynamic Sector Allocation Shifting:** The system continuously evaluates portfolio performance by industry sector. It will suggest *mild to moderate* target allocation shifts over time (e.g., reducing Technology exposure from 30% to 20% if the sector begins underperforming). It is explicitly designed to avoid extreme concentration (e.g., it will never suddenly recommend shifting the portfolio to 99% in one stock or sector).
- **Guardrails:** 
  - Minimum 20 outcomes before suggesting factor shifts.
  - Maximum 5-point weight delta per factor suggestion.
  - Maximum 10-point weight delta per sector shift suggestion.
  - Strict sector concentration caps (e.g., no single sector can exceed 40% of the portfolio).
  - Human approval via the Dashboard is the DEFAULT.

#### E.1 Opt-in autonomous factor-weight apply (Workstream B, 2026-07-01 — DEFAULT OFF)
A default-off `policy.tuning.autoApplyWeights` flag lets a cadence-gated caller apply the auto-tuner's
factor-weight suggestions WITHOUT human approval — but ONLY under strictly stronger gates than the manual
suggestion path:
- **Cadence:** hosted in `scheduler.ts` after a successful `runStrategyOnce`, under the single-leader gate,
  on its own slow clock (`AUTO_TUNE_MIN_INTERVAL_HOURS`, default 24h) — NOT the event-driven trigger path.
- **Write scope:** ONLY `proposedPatch.scoringWeights` are applied. The tuning patch's `policy` sub-patch
  (risk caps, `strategyAuthority`, `riskRules`, `sectorCaps`) and free-text `prompt` are NEVER auto-applied,
  so an autonomous run can't loosen a risk control or flip authority to `decide`.
- **Statistical gate:** a stricter-than-manual OOS re-validation on the exact vector to be persisted —
  requires a minimum IC-delta margin over baseline, positive absolute candidate IC, an ICIR floor, and a
  minimum test-date count; a null OOS run (<4 distinct snapshot dates) is a HARD no-apply.
- **Clamp:** each factor delta is re-clamped to ±`MAX_WEIGHT_STEP` (5 points) AFTER normalization.
- **Persistence + revert:** applied via `setPolicy` (syncs account_strategy_state + the active-profile
  mirror); an `auto_weight_apply` audit row stores the prior vector so `revertAutonomousWeightTuning`
  restores it. Off by default → the human-approval path above is unchanged.

#### E.2 Congress-signal go/no-go gating (Workstream B — DEFAULT OFF)
A default-off `policy.tuning.congressGoNoGoGating` flag gates the congressional scan contribution on a cached
statistical verdict (`congress-score-eval` → three-way PASS / FAIL_SIGNIFICANCE / INSUFFICIENT). Only a
data-backed significance failure down-weights the term to zero; a data-poor account resolves to INSUFFICIENT
and stays neutral (never a permanent kill-switch). Verdict cached out of the scan hot path, surfaced on the
dashboard, refreshed via `POST /api/admin/congress-score-eval`.

#### E.3 Confidence calibration → sizing (Workstream B — DEFAULT OFF)
A default-off `policy.tuning.calibrationSizing` flag remaps a BUY proposal's `confidenceScore` DOWN toward its
realized (Bayesian-shrunk, isotonic-across-bands, per-band-sample-gated) win rate before it becomes the
conviction sizing multiplier — de-risking persistent over-confidence. Reduce-only; shorts fall back to raw;
composes as a reduction feeding the existing conviction cap.

#### E.4 Execution cost on protective exits (Workstream B — correctness fix, ON)
The paper execution-cost model now also debits EXIT fills booked by `synthetic-stops.ts` and
`order-replacement.ts` (previously they inserted raw-price exits with no cost), so the learning loop's
realized edge is net-of-cost on both legs — not just entries. The default paper floor is the same
20 bps constant as OOS walk-forward (`OOS_ROUND_TRIP_COST_BPS` / `PAPER_DEFAULT_BASE_SLIPPAGE_BPS`);
paper trains live, so a 1 bp paper default was dishonest.

#### E.5 Unified learning-mutation ledger + admin revert (follow-on P0-4 — ledger ALWAYS-ON, revert admin-only)
Every autonomous learning mutation now lands in ONE canonical append-only ledger (`learning_mutations`
table; CRUD in `src/lib/db-learning-ledger.ts`; orchestration in `src/lib/learning-ledger.ts`). Each row
carries the subsystem (`scoring_weights` today), the before/after full weight vectors, the trigger/run id,
the OOS/statistical evidence, the authorizing flag, and a timestamp. `applyAutonomousWeightTuning` records
here (capturing `before` ATOMICALLY, immediately before the `setPolicy` write) and still writes the legacy
`auto_weight_apply` audit row for dashboard back-compat. `revertLearningMutation` restores the prior vector
via `setPolicy` ONLY (keeping `account_strategy_state` + the active-profile mirror in sync), scoped by
`(user, account, subsystem)`, and marks the row reverted (idempotent). This GENERALIZES the #296
tuning-specific revert — it does not duplicate it. Recording is passive/always-on (audit trail only — it
changes no trading behavior). The one-click revert route `POST /api/admin/learning-ledger` is `requireAdmin`
(this repo has prior IDOR history); `GET` lists entries for the caller's active account.

#### E.6 Paired-t significance on the autonomous OOS gate (follow-on P0-2 — DEFAULT no-op)
The autonomous OOS gate (E.1) is extended with a proper effect-size + PAIRED-t significance test on the
per-fold IC deltas. Because the candidate and baseline composite ICs are measured on the SAME test fold and
are highly correlated, the difference's standard error comes from the PAIRED per-date IC-difference series
(`pairedICDiffStats` in `backtest.ts`, surfaced on `OOSResult.pairedICDiff`), NOT from differencing two
independent ICIRs. Two default-preserving knobs: `policy.tuning.minOosICImprovement` (default 0 → today's
env `AUTO_TUNE_MIN_IC_DELTA` margin) raises the IC-delta MARGIN; `policy.tuning.minOosPairedTStat` (default 0
= paired-t OFF) requires `pairedN ≥ 2 && pairedT ≥ threshold`. Multiplicity control across repeated
auto-applies (Šidák/Bonferroni, expansion-doc D-1) is explicitly deferred — it earns teeth only once a
per-account trial counter exists, and with the paired-t defaulting off there is nothing to correct today.

#### E.7 Fail-closed tuning-config invariant guard (follow-on P0-3 — validator ALWAYS-ON, gating autonomous-only)
A pure always-on validator (`validateTuningInvariants` in `src/lib/tuning-invariants.ts`) checks a small set
of HARD safety couplings in `policy.tuning`: sample gates > 0; `sizingFloorPct ≤ sizingCeilingPct`;
`autoApplyWeights ⇒ oosWithholdUnvalidated` (unless the explicit `autoApplyOverrideUnvalidated` escape
hatch); `calibrationSizing ⇒ a positive per-band sample gate`. The AUTONOMOUS apply path calls it at the TOP
and fails CLOSED — on any violation it SKIPS the apply, writes an `auto_weight_apply_skipped` audit row, and
returns without throwing (a throw would wedge the scheduler tick). The MANUAL tune route surfaces the same
violations as non-blocking `tuningConfigWarnings` for human review.

#### E.8 Deterministic dry-run / replay harness (broader-backlog P1-1 — read-only, admin-only)
The autonomous gate logic is factored into a shared, SIDE-EFFECT-FREE evaluator (`evaluateAutonomousWeight-
Tuning` in `src/lib/strategy-tuning.ts`) consumed by both the real apply and a new read-only replay
`dryRunAutonomousWeightTuning`. The dry-run runs the FULL gate (propose → write-scope-strip → clamp → stricter
OOS + paired-t + P2-5/P2-6 guards) and returns exactly what an apply WOULD do — `{ wouldApply, before, after,
clampedDeltas, oosICCandidate/Baseline, oosReadout, invariantViolations }` — with ZERO writes (no `setPolicy`,
ledger, audit, or cadence advance; asserted by spies). Exposed at `GET /api/admin/tuning-dry-run`
(`requireAdmin`, mirrors the backtest-ic "suggestion only" pattern). The operator on-ramp: inspect the decision
before enabling `autoApplyWeights`.

#### E.9 Purged & embargoed walk-forward split (broader-backlog P1-2 — DEFAULT off, byte-identical)
`splitWalkForward` gained an opt-in `{ purge }` control and `runWalkForwardOOS` an `purgeEmbargo` option
(`policy.tuning.oosPurgeEmbargo`). The `horizonDays` EMBARGO (drop the first `horizonDays` test-date buckets)
already existed; the PURGE additionally drops the LAST `horizonDays` TRAIN-date buckets whose forward window
straddles the boundary (train↔test bar-overlap leakage — the exact metric the autonomous gate actuates). Off by
default → the split is byte-identical (embargo-only). Fails safe: purging shrinks the train sample, which can
only strip weights.

#### E.10 Auto-tuning shadow / forward-A-B ledger (broader-backlog P1-3 — DEFAULT off)
`policy.tuning.shadowWeightLedger` (default off): each autonomous-tuning EVALUATION records a passive SHADOW row
in the #300 `learning_mutations` ledger (trigger `auto_weight_shadow`, distinct from the real-apply trigger so
no revert path restores it) capturing what the tuner WOULD have applied + the OOS readout — WITHOUT touching
policy. Independent of `autoApplyWeights` (records the would-be decision even when real auto-apply is off), so an
operator can forward-validate the tuner's decisions before trusting autonomy. Overlap-aware SE for a hard
"shadow underperforms" gate is future work.

#### E.11 Survivorship & look-ahead certification (broader-backlog P1-4 — diagnostic/test-only, gates nothing)
Two deliverables. HARD: `isPointInTimeForwardExit()` (pure) + a CI-failing unit test asserting a forward return
uses a bar strictly AFTER the snapshot date at/after `horizonDays` (a same-day or pre-horizon exit is rejected).
SOFT: `certifyForwardResolution()` (IO) reports the fraction of snapshotted candidates with a resolvable forward
price and a point-in-time-clean flag — explicitly labeled a SURVIVORSHIP PROXY that does NOT certify absence of
survivorship bias and gates nothing.

#### E.12 Missed-opportunity hit-rate + benchmark parity (broader-backlog P2-1/P2-2 — DEFAULT off)
`summarizeMissedOpportunities` gained `requireHitRate` (`policy.tuning.missedOpportunityRequireHitRate`, default
off): instead of a winners-only count it tallies per-factor total (winners AND losers) over ALL matured skipped
rows and flags a recurring factor only when its benchmark-beating hit rate, SHRUNK toward the overall skipped
base rate, clears that base rate with a minimum denominator. P2-2: the SAME benchmark-relative test classifies
both winners and losers, so the per-factor signal is net-of-benchmark on both sides. `proposeStrategyTuning`
widens the skipped fetch to 100 rows when on so the base rate isn't biased toward the top-12 winners.

#### E.13 Signed/directional top-bucket congress gate (broader-backlog P2-3 — DEFAULT off)
`evaluateCongressScore` gained `requireTopBucketPositive` (`policy.tuning.congressRequireTopBucketPositive`): the
go/no-go additionally requires the TOP score bucket's OWN excess return to be positive with a min-n floor, so a
symmetric top-minus-bottom spread whose edge lives entirely in the (unused, long-biased app) short bottom leg no
longer passes. Wired through both the admin eval route and the P2-8 refresher; off by default → verdicts
unchanged.

#### E.14 IC-weight shrinkage, drawdown guard, starvation guard, provenance (broader-backlog P2-4/5/6/7)
- **P2-4** `deriveWeightsFromICs(ics, fallback, λ)` blends the data-derived vector toward `DEFAULT_SCORING_WEIGHTS`
  (`w=λ·w_IC+(1−λ)·w_default`, renormalized), read from `policy.tuning.icWeightShrinkage` (default 0 = pure IC).
- **P2-5** `runWalkForwardOOS` now also returns `candidate/baselineMaxDrawdownPct` (two extra top-K equity curves
  via the pure `maxDrawdownOfCurve`); the autonomous gate blocks an apply whose candidate DD exceeds baseline by
  >2 points, but only when `testDates ≥ 8` (below the floor the IC/paired-t gate governs).
  `policy.tuning.autoApplyDrawdownGuard`, default off.
- **P2-6** `policy.tuning.minOosTestDates` raises the distinct-test-date floor above the `AUTO_TUNE_MIN_TEST_DATES`
  env default (default 0 = env floor governs) — a starvation guard so a thin fixed 500-row window can't pass.
- **P2-7** each real apply writes `audit('tuning_apply_provenance', …)` with the fold shape (train/test dates +
  observation counts), ICs/ICIR/paired-t, drawdowns, thresholds, and the flags in effect, so an IO+time-dependent
  apply is reproducible/auditable.

#### E.15 Congress go/no-go scheduled + cached + fixtured (broader-backlog P2-8 — DEFAULT off gate)
`refreshCongressScoreVerdict()` (in `congress-score-gate.ts`) is a cadence-callable refresher that computes
`evaluateCongressScore` from `buildCongressScoreObservations` and persists the verdict, moving the expensive
OHLC-backed eval OFF the scan hot path (the cheap read-time cache + fail-open staleness already existed). Honors
P2-3. Covered by a fixtured vitest (recorded `signal_snapshot` rows + an injected OHLC fetcher + a fixed
`placeboSeed`) asserting the three-way verdict + the P2-3 reason. **D-1** (multiplicity-aware significance) is
DEFERRED — it needs a per-account trial counter and has no teeth until the paired-t is on. **P1-5** (calibration
remap monotone+shrunk) was verified ALREADY shipped in #296 (`calibratedConviction`) and skipped.

## 4. Test Plan
- **Context/Outcome Fixture:** Seed buy/sell fills and assert that `entryMarketRegime`, `mae`, and `mfe` are accurately captured and calculated.
- **Post-Mortem Generation:** Test the async reflection LLM prompt to ensure it synthesizes raw outcomes into a concise paragraph.
- **Weight Shifting Logic:** Create a mock history of failing "Value" trades and assert that the system successfully suggests a negative delta to the Fundamentals weight.

## 5. Sequencing
1. Implement the expanded `StrategyOutcome` schema and the 4-Pillar data fetching (Macro, Fundamentals, Technicals, News).
2. Implement the Asynchronous Post-Mortem task to generate the `reflection_summary`.
3. Feed the reflection summary into the main `runStrategyOnce` prompt.
4. Implement the human-approved Weight Shifting suggestions in the Dashboard.
