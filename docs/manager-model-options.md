# Manager / Strategist model options — cross-provider evaluation

Decision aid for the sovereign-design question **"which model tier + budget runs the
strategist ('Manager') loop?"** The owner asked for a cross-provider options list (not
Anthropic-only) and a way to evaluate how each performs — including DeepSeek for cost.

## 2026-07-13 current OpenAI policy

## 2026-07-22 rotation availability behavior

When Green or Red is set to rotation, the server now intersects the credential-resolvable curated
pool with OpenRouter's account-filtered `GET /api/v1/models/user` response before choosing a slot.
This prevents a disabled account model such as Claude Fable 5 from being selected by rotation. A
temporary availability-check failure fails rotation closed with an actionable retry message; it does
not silently fall back to another provider or to the other team. Explicit model selections preserve
the existing fail-closed behavior, so an unavailable Red model produces a human-review receipt rather
than being replaced by Green. The account model list is cached in-process for five minutes.

Today's production-schema benchmark successfully called all three GPT-5.6 API IDs (artifact:
`docs/benchmarks/2026-07-13-gpt-5-6-benchmark.md`). The official catalog positions Sol for complex
professional work, Terra for intelligence/cost balance, and Luna for cost-sensitive high volume.
All three expose `none | low | medium | high | xhigh | max` reasoning.

| OpenAI option | $ in / out per 1M | Recommended use | Effort |
|---|---:|---|---|
| GPT-5.6 Sol | 5 / 30 | Red Team; consequential strategy/learning review; difficult manual deep dives | Medium Green/Coach; **High Red/review** |
| GPT-5.6 Terra | 2.5 / 15 | **Green Team** and balanced Coach; Red/review when Sol cost is not justified | **Medium Green/Coach**; High Red/review |
| GPT-5.6 Luna | 1 / 6 | High-volume Coach/synthesis; cost-sensitive Green | Low Coach; Medium Green; prefer Terra/Sol for Red/review |
| GPT-5.4 Mini | 0.75 / 4.5 | Lowest-cost model still advisable as a complete Green seat | Low Coach; Medium Green; High Red/review if deliberately used |
| GPT-5.4 Nano | 0.20 / 1.25 | Extraction, classification, routing, mechanical summaries | Low; **not advisable as the sole Green or Red seat** |

Catalog decision: remove full GPT-5.4 and GPT-5.5 from curated selectors because Terra and Sol are
same-price current successors. Keep stored/custom legacy IDs callable so existing policy does not
break. Keep Mini and Nano: despite its newer generation, Luna is more expensive than both. The app
has no model defaults; these are role recommendations shown before an explicit choice. Terra's Green
and Sol's Red recommendation chips are provisional until realized account-scoped outcomes establish
superiority.

The broader cross-provider analysis below remains useful, but this section supersedes its older
OpenAI rows and any paper-only evaluation wording.

## 1. The candidates

| Provider | Model | $ in | $ out | Context | Reasoning | Wires into this repo via |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Opus 4.8 | 5 | 25 | 1M | adaptive | native Anthropic path (already in the assistant chat) |
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 5 | 3 (2 intro→08-31) | 15 (10 intro) | 1M | adaptive | native Anthropic path |
| Anthropic | Claude Haiku 4.5 | 1 | 5 | 200K | — | native Anthropic path |
| Anthropic | Claude Fable 5 | 10 | 50 | 1M | always-on | native Anthropic path (premium; likely overkill here) |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-5.6 Sol | 5 | 30 | 1.05M | none → max | OpenAI path; explicit model choice |
| OpenAI | GPT-5.6 Terra | 2.50 | 15 | 1.05M | none → max | OpenAI path; explicit model choice |
| OpenAI | GPT-5.6 Luna | 1 | 6 | 1.05M | none → max | OpenAI path; explicit model choice |
| OpenAI | GPT-5.4 Mini | 0.75 | 4.50 | — | effort knob | OpenAI path; retained lower-cost option |
| OpenAI | GPT-5.4 Nano | 0.20 | 1.25 | — | effort knob | OpenAI path; mechanical tasks only |
| **Google** | Gemini 3.1 Pro | 2 | 12 | (200K tier) | thinking | OpenAI-compatible endpoint (base-URL swap) |
| Google | Gemini 3.5 Flash | 1.50 | 9 | — | thinking | OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Google | Gemini 3 Flash Preview | 0.50 | 3 | — | thinking | OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| **DeepSeek** | V4 Pro | 1.74 (promo 0.44) | 3.48 (promo 0.87) | 1M | yes | OpenAI-compatible endpoint (base-URL swap) |
| DeepSeek | V4 Flash | 0.14 | 0.28 | 1M | — | OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| **xAI** | Grok 4.3 | 1.25 | 2.50 | — | reasoning variant | OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| xAI | Grok 4.1 Fast | 0.20 | 0.50 | — | reasoning variant | OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| **Alibaba** | Qwen3.7-Max | 2.50 (promo 1.25) | 7.50 (promo 3.75) | — | `enable_thinking` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Alibaba | Qwen-Plus | 0.40 | 1.20 | — | `enable_thinking` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

**Wiring reality (important):** the strategist loop already speaks the **OpenAI Chat Completions**
shape (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), and the console assistant already has a native Anthropic path. DeepSeek,
xAI, Qwen, and Google all expose **OpenAI-compatible** endpoints — so adding any of them is a
`base_url` + key change and a model-id string, **not** a new integration per provider. That makes an
A/B across providers cheap to stand up.

## 2. Cost reality for THIS workload

The strategist is **low-volume and output-heavy**: a handful of runs per day, each producing a few
schema-constrained proposals plus reasoning. So **output tokens dominate**, and the absolute cost per
run is small even on a premium model. Rough per-run envelope (say ~15K input context + ~8K output
incl. reasoning):

| Model | ~$ / run | ~$ / month @ 20 runs/day |
|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek V4 Flash | ~$0.004 | ~$2.5 |
| Grok 4.1 Fast | ~$0.007 | ~$4 |
| Gemini 3 Flash Preview | ~$0.03 | ~$18 |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro (promo) | ~$0.014 | ~$8 |
| Gemini 3.1 Pro | ~$0.13 | ~$78 |
| Claude Sonnet 5 (intro) | ~$0.11 | ~$66 |
| GPT-5.6 Luna | ~$0.06 | ~$38 |
| GPT-5.6 Terra | ~$0.16 | ~$95 |
| GPT-5.6 Sol | ~$0.32 | ~$190 |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | ~$0.28 | ~$168 |

Takeaway: at this run frequency, **even the most expensive option is ~$150–200/mo**, and the cheapest
are a few dollars. The cost spread is real but the absolute numbers are low — for a role that decides
real-money trades, **capability and reliability should outweigh token cost**. Cost matters more if you
later crank run frequency, add per-account fan-out, or move to high-frequency scanning.

## 3. What actually matters for the strategist role

Not raw benchmark IQ — the things that make a trading strategist safe and usable:

1. **Structured-output / JSON-schema adherence.** Proposals are schema-constrained (`TradeProposal`
   with required `tradeThesisTag`, `entryMarketRegime`, side, sizing…). A model that reliably emits
   valid, complete structured output matters more than one that's 2 points higher on a reasoning eval.
   Anthropic (strict tool use / `output_config.format`) and OpenAI (structured outputs) are the most
   battle-tested here; DeepSeek/Qwen/Grok/Gemini via the OpenAI-compatible path are usually fine but
   should be verified on the actual schema.
2. **Reasoning quality on ambiguous, incomplete market data** — the core judgment call.
3. **Instruction-following / not over-trading** — respecting the "only propose with genuine
   conviction" guidance and the guardrails framing.
4. **Refusal / policy behavior.** Some models refuse finance-adjacent prompts unevenly; the strategist
   prompt is benign but worth checking a model doesn't balk.
5. **Data handling / ToS.** Confirm each provider's terms permit automated trading-assistance use and
   that data-residency/retention fits your posture (esp. non-US providers: DeepSeek, Qwen).

## 4. Recommendation

**Don't pick by spec sheet — measure it.** #334 just landed **`proposedByModel` persistence**, so the
app now records realized win-rate / return / P&L **per model** on Results. That turns "evaluate how
each performs" from a guess into an experiment:

1. **Shortlist 3 to A/B** (spans the capability/cost space):
   - **Claude Sonnet 5** — strong reasoning + best-in-class structured output, ~$0.11/run at intro
     pricing. The balanced default.
   - **DeepSeek V4 Pro** — the cost play the owner flagged; frontier-ish reasoning at ~$0.01/run.
     Verify schema adherence + ToS/data-residency first.
   - **GPT-5.6 Terra or Gemini 3.1 Pro** — a third independent lineage so you're not comparing two similar
     models; pick by whichever you trust more on structured output.
2. **Run attributed comparative rotation** on a deliberately selected broker account over enough
   outcomes. Paper-account results remain isolated unless independently corroborated by live data;
   the Results page and model/source receipts rank concrete serving models within that scope.
3. **Promote the winner** to the live Manager role; keep a cheaper model (DeepSeek V4 Flash / Grok 4.1
   Fast) as the scout/pre-filter tier if you add a two-stage loop later.

**If you want explicit OpenAI picks today without the comparison:** Terra/Medium for Green and
Sol/High for Red; Luna/Low for Coach. These are starting priors, not defaults or realized-performance
claims. Claude Sonnet 5 remains the strongest established cross-provider balanced candidate in the
older benchmark set.

**Budget to set:** at 20 runs/day, **$25–200/mo** covers any single-model choice; **$300/mo** comfortably
covers a 3-model A/B plus headroom. Set the ceiling where you're comfortable and the frequency/tier can
scale into it.

## 5. Wiring notes

- **OpenAI-compatible providers (DeepSeek, xAI, Qwen, Google):** point the existing OpenAI client at the
  provider's `base_url`, set that provider's key, use its model-id string. No per-provider SDK.
  - DeepSeek: `https://api.deepseek.com` · Grok: `https://api.x.ai/v1` · Gemini:
    `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/` · Qwen (intl):
    `https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`.
- **Anthropic:** native path already exists in the console assistant; reuse it for the strategist.
- **Structured output:** validate the `TradeProposal` schema round-trips on each candidate before
  trusting it in a run — providers vary in JSON-schema strictness.
- Keep the model choice a **policy/setting** (per the existing model-picker surface) so the A/B is a
  config change, not a code change, and `proposedByModel` stamps each run correctly.

## 6. Caveats
- **Pricing/models change monthly** — re-verify before committing (sources below).
- **Reasoning tokens bill as output** on every provider here — a reasoning model's real per-run cost is
  higher than its sticker if it thinks a lot; the envelope in §2 already assumes reasoning output.
- **Non-US providers (DeepSeek, Qwen):** confirm ToS permits this use and that data handling fits your
  requirements before sending real portfolio context.
