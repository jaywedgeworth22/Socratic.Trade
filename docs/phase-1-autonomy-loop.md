# Phase 1 Spec — Autonomy Loop

**Historical implementation spec.** This was the original Phase 1 handoff for a
fresh implementation session. The core scheduler, run lock, market-session state,
and dashboard controls now exist; keep this file as design history and use
`STATUS.md` plus current code as the live source of truth before changing the
autonomy path.

Current hardening gaps: market holidays ARE now modeled via `getMarketHolidays()`
in `src/lib/market-hours.ts` (the Phase 1 documented limitation is resolved).
Scheduler behavior is local single-process, and any dev-server `EMFILE` watcher
issue is operational rather than a strategy-loop feature gap.

2026-07-21 hardening note: the LLM provider cooldown planner preserves the invariant that a
non-empty Green/Red failover chain never becomes empty when every lane is cooling, including
all-billing cooldowns. A manual billing/credit fix can therefore recover on the next run instead
of waiting out the cooldown TTL.

## Objective

Make `policy.enabled` actually drive autonomous strategy runs on a schedule, safely:
- A background scheduler calls `runStrategyOnce()` at a configurable cadence when autonomy
  is enabled, the kill switch is off, and the US market is open.
- A run lock guarantees no two runs (scheduled or manual) overlap.
- The `strategy_run` audit event is written for **every** run path, not just the HTTP route.
- The dashboard shows scheduler state (next run, runs today, cadence control).

## Background / current state

- `runStrategyOnce()` lives in `src/lib/strategy.ts`. It is only ever called by
  `app/api/strategy/run/route.ts`, which **also** writes `audit("strategy_run", result)`.
  That audit write must move into the lib so the scheduler path records it too.
- `app/api/strategy/enable/route.ts` sets `enabled: true`; `pause/route.ts` sets
  `enabled: false`. Nothing consumes `enabled`.
- Policy is a single JSON blob in the `settings` table (`src/lib/db.ts` `getPolicy`/
  `setPolicy`, defaults in `src/lib/defaults.ts`, type in `src/lib/types.ts`).
- `package.json` has `"type": "module"`, Next 15.5, React 19. No `next.config.*` and no
  `instrumentation.ts` exist yet. Next 15 instrumentation is stable (no experimental flag).
- The dashboard auto-refreshes `/api/dashboard` every 30s (`app/dashboard-client.tsx`).

## Tasks

### 1. Move the audit write into the domain function

In `src/lib/strategy.ts`, at the **end** of `runStrategyOnce()` (both the success return
and the `catch` path), call `audit("strategy_run", result)` before returning, where
`result` is the `StrategyResult` being returned. Import `audit` from `./db` (already
imported in that file).

Then in `app/api/strategy/run/route.ts`, **remove** the now-duplicate
`audit("strategy_run", result)` line (keep everything else). Verify the audit is written
exactly once per run.

### 2. New policy fields

In `src/lib/types.ts`, add to `TradingPolicy`:

```ts
runCadenceMinutes: number;        // how often the scheduler runs while enabled
runDuringExtendedHours: boolean;  // if true, also run during pre/post market
```

In `src/lib/defaults.ts`, add to `DEFAULT_POLICY`:

```ts
runCadenceMinutes: 60,
runDuringExtendedHours: false,
```

`getPolicy()` already spreads `DEFAULT_POLICY` over stored values, so existing rows pick up
the new defaults automatically — no migration needed.

### 3. Market-hours helper

Create `src/lib/market-hours.ts`:

```ts
// Returns the current US market session in America/New_York time.
// Regular session: Mon–Fri 09:30–16:00 ET. Extended: 04:00–09:30 and 16:00–20:00 ET.
// Note: does NOT account for market holidays in this phase (documented limitation).
export type MarketSession = "closed" | "regular" | "pre" | "post";

export function currentMarketSession(now = new Date()): MarketSession { /* ... */ }

// True if a run is allowed now given the extended-hours preference.
export function isRunAllowedNow(runDuringExtendedHours: boolean, now = new Date()): boolean {
  const s = currentMarketSession(now);
  if (s === "regular") return true;
  if (runDuringExtendedHours && (s === "pre" || s === "post")) return true;
  return false;
}
```

Implementation notes:
- Compute ET wall-clock via `Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", { timeZone: "America/New_York",
  hour12: false, weekday: "short", hour: "2-digit", minute: "2-digit" })` and parse parts.
  Do **not** rely on the server's local timezone.
- Weekend (Sat/Sun ET) → `"closed"`.
- Add a unit test `test/market-hours.test.ts` (vitest) covering: a Wednesday 10:00 ET →
  `regular`; Wednesday 08:00 ET → `pre`; Wednesday 18:00 ET → `post`; Saturday → `closed`;
  and `isRunAllowedNow(false, ...)` false during pre/post but true during regular.
  Construct deterministic inputs by passing a fixed UTC `Date` that maps to the intended ET
  time (account for the offset; add a comment).

### 4. Run lock

Add a lock so overlapping runs cannot double-count daily limits. Use a DB-backed lock in
the `settings` table (survives across the scheduler and HTTP route, which share one
process but this is the robust choice).

In `src/lib/db.ts` add:

```ts
// Returns true if the lock was acquired. Stale locks older than staleMs are reclaimed.
export function acquireStrategyLock(staleMs = 5 * 60_000, now = new Date()): boolean
export function releaseStrategyLock(): void
```

Implementation:
- Store JSON `{ lockedAt: ISO }` under settings key `strategy_run_lock` (use the existing
  `getSetting`/`setSetting`, or write directly — but note `setSetting` emits a
  `policy_change` audit event, which is noisy for a lock; prefer a direct prepared
  statement that does NOT audit).
- `acquireStrategyLock`: read current lock; if absent or `now - lockedAt > staleMs`, write
  the lock and return true; else return false.
- `releaseStrategyLock`: delete the `strategy_run_lock` settings row.
- This is single-process so a simple read-then-write is acceptable; wrap acquire in a
  `better-sqlite3` transaction (`db.transaction(...)`) to be safe.

In `src/lib/strategy.ts` `runStrategyOnce()`:
- At the very top (before `insertStrategyRun`), `if (!acquireStrategyLock()) return { runId:
  "", status: "failed", summary: "A strategy run is already in progress.", proposals: [] };`
  — and do **not** write a strategy_run audit for the lock-rejected case, and do **not**
  create a strategy_runs row. (Return early before any DB writes.)
- Wrap the rest of the body so `releaseStrategyLock()` runs in a `finally`.

### 5. Scheduler (instrumentation)

Create `instrumentation.ts` at the **project root** (sibling of `package.json`). Next 15
calls the exported `register()` once per server process at startup.

```ts
export async function register() {
  // Only run in the Node.js server runtime, never edge/browser.
  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME !== "nodejs") return;
  const { startScheduler } = await import("./src/lib/scheduler");
  startScheduler();
}
```

Create `src/lib/scheduler.ts`:

- Module-level `let timer: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;` and `let lastRunAt: string | null`
  and `let nextRunAt: string | null` (exported via a `getSchedulerState()` accessor).
- `startScheduler()`: guard against double-start (`if (timer) return`). Use a **fixed short
  tick** (e.g. every 60s) rather than a long `setInterval` tied to cadence, so cadence and
  enabled-state changes take effect without a restart. Each tick:
  1. `const policy = getPolicy();`
  2. If `!policy.enabled || policy.killSwitch || !policy.accountNumber` → set
     `nextRunAt = null`, return.
  3. If `!isRunAllowedNow(policy.runDuringExtendedHours)` → return (market closed).
  4. If `lastRunAt` and `now - lastRunAt < runCadenceMinutes * 60_000` → return (not due
     yet); keep `nextRunAt = lastRunAt + cadence`.
  5. Otherwise: `lastRunAt = now`; `await runStrategyOnce()` (it writes its own audit and
     respects the run lock); set `nextRunAt = now + cadence`. Wrap in try/catch so a thrown
     error never kills the timer.
- Use `.unref()` on the timer so it doesn't hold the process open in dev.
- Export `getSchedulerState(): { lastRunAt: string | null; nextRunAt: string | null }`.

**Dev caveat to document in code:** Next dev with HMR may call `register()` more than once
across reloads; the `if (timer) return` guard plus module caching makes this safe in
practice. In production (`next start`) it runs once.

### 6. Surface scheduler state

- In `src/lib/dashboard.ts` `getDashboardSnapshot()`, add `scheduler:
  getSchedulerState()` and `marketSession: currentMarketSession()` to the returned object.
- In `app/dashboard-client.tsx`:
  - Extend the `Snapshot` type with `scheduler?: { lastRunAt: string | null; nextRunAt:
    string | null }` and `marketSession?: string`.
  - In the status grid, add readouts: market session (e.g. "Market: regular") and
    "Next run: HH:MM" (or "—" when paused/closed).
  - In the Risk/Controls area, add a cadence control: a `NumberField` (component already
    exists) bound to `runCadenceMinutes` and a toggle for `runDuringExtendedHours`, both
    persisted via the existing `updatePolicy(...)`.

## Out of scope for Phase 1

- Market holiday calendar (documented limitation in `market-hours.ts`).
- Order fill reconciliation (Phase 3).
- Multi-process / serverless scheduling (this app is single-process local).

## Acceptance criteria

These criteria describe the original implementation target. Re-verify them when
touching scheduler, lock, market-hours, or dashboard runtime controls.

- [ ] With `ROBINHOOD_ADAPTER=mock`, enabling autonomy and setting cadence to 1 minute
      causes `runStrategyOnce()` to fire automatically during a simulated open session;
      `strategy_runs` rows and a `strategy_run` audit event appear without clicking
      "Run Once".
- [ ] Pausing autonomy or tripping the kill switch stops scheduled runs within one tick.
- [ ] Two near-simultaneous runs (e.g. manual click during a scheduled run) never both
      proceed — the second returns "already in progress".
- [ ] The `strategy_run` audit is written exactly once per executed run (grep the audit
      feed; no duplicates, none missing).
- [ ] Outside market hours (and with extended hours off), no scheduled runs occur.
- [ ] `npm test` passes, including the new `market-hours` tests.
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds (instrumentation compiles).
- [ ] Dashboard shows market session and next-run time; cadence + extended-hours controls
      persist across refresh.

## Verify (run the app)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # boot; confirm scheduler logs once
```

Then in the UI (mock adapter): select the mock account, set an allowlist, enable autonomy,
set cadence to 1 min, and confirm runs appear in Run History on their own. Also run
`npm test` and `npm run build`.
