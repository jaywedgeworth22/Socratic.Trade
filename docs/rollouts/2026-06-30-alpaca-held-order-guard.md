# 2026-06-30 - Alpaca Held Order Exit Guard and Order Lifecycle

## Summary

Fixed broker-backed sell/cover placement so the strategy blocks duplicate exits
when an existing broker order already reserves the shares. The guard runs before
autonomous placement and before manual proposal approval.

Also clarified broker order lifecycle and stale limit handling. Broker-submitted
orders now display as `Submitted` / `Working` until broker/fill truth says they
executed, broker-paper pending fills do not count in paper P&L/projection until
filled, and broker-backed limit or stop-limit orders can alert after a
customizable threshold (`staleLimitOrderMinutes`, default 15 minutes).

## Why

Production KO approval failed on Alpaca Paper with:

- proposal `1463a40c-f41b-4530-b203-60be7fcdaa81`
- run `7a2b9237-297e-44a9-b7cc-fe161a41d189`
- account `PA33IDTHMFK9`
- requested KO sell quantity `17`
- Alpaca error `40310000`: `existing_qty=29`, `held_for_orders=29`, `available=0`
- related held order `2a6ae4c7-c7d3-450c-a9c0-7a9a6a9099e5`

The related order was a broker-held KO bracket sell leg from the prior KO buy
order, so the app's prior check `sell quantity <= position quantity` was
insufficient. Broker availability was actually `position quantity - open/held
sell orders`.

The same incident made the UI ambiguity visible: Alpaca Paper can accept an
order without executing it immediately, especially with limit orders. A broker
order being submitted is materially different from a fill hitting the portfolio,
so the app now treats broker state and fill reconciliation as separate display
and accounting facts.

## Verification

- `npm ci` - passed.
- `npx vitest run test/broker-held-orders.test.ts` - passed, 6 tests.
- `npx vitest run test/broker-held-orders.test.ts test/stale-limit-orders.test.ts test/dashboard-feed.test.ts test/performance.test.ts test/policy-notification-events.test.ts` - passed, 5 files / 63 tests.
- `npm run lint` - passed with 0 errors and 256 existing warnings.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` - passed.
- `npm test` - passed, 163 files / 1568 tests after merging `origin/main`.
- `npm run build` - passed.
- `rg -n "source === \"paper\"|pending_reconciliation|executionMode === \"test/local\"|filled" src/lib/performance.ts test -g '*.ts'` - typo run with an unquoted shell glob failed under zsh during exploration; no files changed.

## Follow-ups

- Consider parsing broker-native available/held position fields if Alpaca or
  another broker exposes them consistently. The current guard uses the existing
  portable position + open-order data already available through `BrokerGateway`.
- Consider a separate, explicitly confirmed cancel-and-market-replace flow. This
  patch alerts and clarifies status but does not add a one-click market
  replacement because that path can touch live capital and needs its own
  confirmation guard.
