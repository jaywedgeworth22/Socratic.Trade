# Rollout Note: 2026-07-31 — Admin DNS & Host Routing Fix for admin.socratictrade.com

## 1. Context & Objective
The user requested: "admin.socratictrade.com needs to have dns fixed so it works properly".
Upon inspection, curling `https://admin.socratictrade.com` failed with **Cloudflare Error 525 (SSL Handshake Failed)**.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis
1. **Cloudflare DNS**: `admin.socratictrade.com` A record pointed to `141.148.182.224` (the Oracle Cloud Coolify box) with `proxied: true` (orange cloud). Cloudflare SSL mode is set to **Full**.
2. **Server Reverse Proxy (Caddy on Oracle Cloud `141.148.182.224`)**:
   - `oracle-caddy-1` listened on ports 80/443.
   - `/etc/usage-monitor/Caddyfile` defined virtual hosts for `socratictrade.com, www.socratictrade.com`, `host.jays.services`, `socratic.trade`, and `congress.trade`.
   - `admin.socratictrade.com` was missing from the `socratictrade.com` site block.
   - When Cloudflare initiated the TLS handshake to `141.148.182.224:443` for `admin.socratictrade.com`, Caddy had no matching site block or certificate, returning a TLS alert internal error which Cloudflare surfaced as HTTP 525.

## 3. Changes Made
- **Server Infrastructure (Caddy on `141.148.182.224`)**:
  - Updated `/etc/usage-monitor/Caddyfile` to include `admin.socratictrade.com` and `*.socratictrade.com` under the `socratic-app:4000` block:
    ```caddyfile
    socratictrade.com, www.socratictrade.com, admin.socratictrade.com, *.socratictrade.com {
      encode zstd gzip
      reverse_proxy socratic-app:4000
      tls internal
    }
    ```
  - Reloaded Caddy (`caddy reload`), resolving the SSL 525 error immediately. `https://admin.socratictrade.com` now returns HTTP 200 via Cloudflare.
- **Middleware Host Routing (`middleware.ts`)**:
  - Added host-level routing for `admin.socratictrade.com` and `admin.socratic.trade`.
  - Requests for `/` on `admin.socratictrade.com` automatically redirect to `/admin`.
  - Shorthand admin paths (`/server`, `/connections`, `/llm-usage`, `/rag-coverage`, `/transcript`) automatically redirect to `/admin<path>`.
- **Tests (`test/middleware-auth.test.ts`)**:
  - Added unit test cases verifying host routing redirects for `admin.socratictrade.com`.

## 4. Verification State
- `curl -isL https://admin.socratictrade.com` -> HTTP 200 (Clean response via Cloudflare edge proxy).
- `npx vitest test/middleware-auth.test.ts --run` -> All 38 tests passed.
- `npm run lint` -> Passed with 0 errors.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` -> Passed cleanly with 0 type errors.
- `npm test` -> All 418 test files and 4,893 tests passed.
- `npm run build` -> Full Next.js production build succeeded.
