# Rollout Note: PR Merge Resolution and Production Health Verification

## Summary
Successfully resolved merge conflicts for all three open PRs (PR #175, PR #160, PR #141) by re-merging `origin/main` into their respective branches and verifying their compilation and test passes. Also verified the health and scheduler status of the PM2 production server (`trading`).

## Why
Merge conflicts on `PLAN.md`, `STATUS.md`, `app/dashboard-client.tsx`, and `src/lib/chat/orchestrator.ts` were blocking the GitHub Actions CI verification workflows for the open PRs, preventing automated landing/merging. Additionally, the production site status needed verification and troubleshooting to ensure it was running normally.

## Files Touched
We checked out the branches for each PR, resolved conflicts locally, verified them, and pushed them back to GitHub:
- Branch `claude/wonderful-wozniak-xploaq` (PR #175)
  - Resolved conflicts in `app/dashboard-client.tsx` and `STATUS.md`
- Branch `claude/crossapp-consumer-reads-y8ojii` (PR #160)
  - Resolved conflicts in `PLAN.md` and `STATUS.md`
- Branch `claude/chat-readonly-state-tools` (PR #141)
  - Resolved conflicts in `src/lib/chat/orchestrator.ts` and `STATUS.md`

## Verification
For each branch, local verification was performed before pushing:
- **PR #175**:
  - `./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit` -> Passed with no type errors.
  - `npm test` -> 1441/1441 passed.
  - `npm run build` -> Production Next.js build completed successfully.
- **PR #160**:
  - `./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit && npm test` -> 1446/1446 passed.
- **PR #141**:
  - `./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit && npm test` -> 1442/1442 passed.

### Production Health Check
Ran `pm2 list` and `pm2 show trading` to verify production status:
- Production `trading` process on port 4000 is online.
- Healthy health-check verify run:
  - `curl -i http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/health` returns `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` and `{"ok":true,"checks":{"db":"ok","schedulerLastTick":"...","schedulerAgeSeconds":26,...}}`.
- Verified that the scheduler is ticking normally and database integrity is sound.

## Follow-ups
- Await the GitHub Actions CI checks (`verify` workflow) to go green for the open PRs on GitHub. Once green, they will merge automatically since auto-merge is armed.
