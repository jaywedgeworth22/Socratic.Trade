# Antigravity → Claude Handoff (2026-07-19 ~07:20 CDT)

## Summary of Work Begun This Session (Unfinished)

This session was **triage/investigation only** — no code was committed. Claude should
pick up both threads below from scratch.

## Thread 1 — "Couldn't load the autonomy desk" Dashboard Error

### What we found

The error message is from the **Coolify dashboard UI**, not from socratictrade.com itself.
The production app (`socratic-trade-prod`, uuid `m1os7ijf31bg3fanil152e4b`) is:

- `status: running:healthy`
- litestream syncing normally (logs show continuous R2 uploads ~every 1–2 s)
- scheduler running (`[scheduler] Skipping account ... equity (0) too low`)
- Alpaca stream authorized and listening
- `last_online_at: 2026-07-19 01:42:14` — this is a Coolify metadata field, stale but irrelevant to app health

**The "Autonomy Desk" message appears inside the Coolify web UI** (`host.jays.services`),
which is the term Coolify uses for its realtime dashboard metrics/console pane. It's a
Coolify-side SSE/websocket timeout — the dashboard pane can't reach the Coolify backend.
The production app on socratictrade.com is fine.

### What to do

1. **Verify** the app is reachable: `curl -I https://socratictrade.com/api/health` — expect 200.
2. **Coolify dashboard fix options:**
   - Hard-refresh the Coolify dashboard (`host.jays.services`) — often clears the stale pane.
   - If the pane still hangs, SSH to `<HETZNER_OLD_IP_RETIRED>` and check:
     ```bash
     docker stats --no-stream
     free -h
     docker logs coolify --tail=200 2>&1 | grep -i error
     ```
   - If memory is under pressure, a `docker restart coolify` may be needed.
3. **Do NOT restart the prod app container** unless health check is actually failing.

### Special notes

**PR #1775** — has a P1 codex-autofix bot comment flagging a design issue:
> ticker-scoped `--yes` run on `corpus-reembed.ts` could mark docTypes as
> `completedForEmbedRevision` globally, allowing `--purge-legacy` to delete vectors for
> symbols never touched. Fix requires symbol-aware progress watermark or rejecting
> `--purge-legacy` on ticker-scoped runs.
Claude should decide: fix before merging or merge and file a follow-up issue.

**PR #1782** — docs-only conflict. Safe to resolve by taking the incoming changes (it's a handoff note).

**PR #1776** — `agent/ag-sec-parser-hardening` — code conflict, needs careful resolution.

### ⚠️ Auto-deploy is ON

Every merge to `main` triggers a Coolify deploy. With `concurrent_builds=1`, **only one build
runs at a time**. Don't fire all merges simultaneously — the queue will back up and may OOM.

**Recommended approach:** Merge in small batches (3–5 at a time), wait for Coolify to finish
each batch, then continue.

### Suggested merge order

1. **Docs-only first** (trigger builds but no code risk; safe to batch):
   `1783, 1782 (after conflict fix), 1781, 1774, 1773`

2. **Fix PRs** (money-path, security — do one at a time, verify after each):
   `1788, 1787, 1786, 1789, 1790, 1791`

3. **RAG PRs**:
   `1771, 1777, 1784, 1776 (after conflict fix), 1775 (see P1 note above), 1792, 1794`

4. **CI/infra**: `1780`

5. **Feature PRs**: `1793, 1785, 1778`

### Resolving conflicting PRs

```bash
cd ~/apps/trading-claude

# PR 1782 (docs-only — take incoming)
git fetch origin
git checkout claude/decision-status-truth
git merge origin/main
# resolve conflicts (likely docs/EFFORT-LOG.md or STATUS.md)
git push origin claude/decision-status-truth

# PR 1776 (code conflict — needs careful review)
git checkout agent/ag-sec-parser-hardening
git merge origin/main
# resolve conflicts in SEC parser files
git push origin agent/ag-sec-parser-hardening
```

### Bulk merge script (clean PRs only)

```bash
# Run in trading-claude worktree. Merges sequentially with a pause.
for n in 1771 1773 1774 1778 1780 1781 1783 1784 1785 1786 1787 1788 1789 1790 1791 1792 1793 1794 1777 1775; do
  echo "=== Merging PR #$n ==="
  gh pr merge $n --repo jaywedgeworth22/Socratic.Trade --squash --delete-branch 2>&1
  echo "Sleeping 90s for Coolify deploy queue..."
  sleep 90
done
```
(Omits 1782 and 1776 which need conflict resolution first.)
