# 2026-08-15 — iOS Proposals For Review, price delay, and target debate

## 1. Context & Objective

Owner: the Home count should say **Proposals For Review** under the number, not
"Awaiting Review".  On the review list, show the price at proposal time, the
live price, the proposer's guessed target, and how much delay changed the
trade.  When a proposer leaves the target blank, Green + Red debate whether a
target and a staged exit would help.

## 2. Changes Made

- Home tile title is `Proposals for Review` above the count, with no subtitle
  so the card matches Open P&L height.  Owner correction: not a line under
  the number, and not the bare title `Proposals`.
- Proposal queue heading is `N Proposals for Review`.
- Review cards list **Proposed**, **Now** (with signed %), **Target** (with
  dollars left, or `none`), **Delay** (better/worse $ on the proposed size),
  and **Stop** when present.
- Target comes from `bracketTakeProfit`, then `scorecard.sniperPoints.takeProfit`.
- Delay is side-aware: a buy that rose is worse; a short that rose is better.
- Missing target shows the Green Team `exitPlan` when present, otherwise a
  short fallback that the panel should debate a target and staged exits.
- Green Team prompt `agentic-strategy@2.9.0` requires that debate in `exitPlan`
  when the target is omitted, and prefers a staged-exit note even when a single
  target is set.  Red Team Job 3 reviews a missing target without inventing an
  exit objection when the levels are already coherent.
- Optional `TradeProposal.exitPlan` is sanitized (trim, 2k cap) and decoded on
  iOS.

## 3. Decisions & Trade-offs

- Did not add a new LLM call.  The existing Green/Red pair is the expert panel.
- `exitPlan` is optional and not in `BULL_PROPOSAL_REQUIRED_KEYS`, so a truncated
  repair is not discarded for missing it.
- Did not change web console cards in this pass (owner asked for iOS).  The
  snapshot already carried reference/current; only the target/exitPlan needed
  decoding on the phone.
- Delay $ uses proposed quantity × price move.  Dollar-amount-only openings
  without quantity show the % move only.

## 4. Verification State

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npx vitest run test/strategy-hardening.test.ts test/strategy-exit-plan-prompts.test.ts test/strategy-prompt-safety.test.ts
# 97 targeted tests green.  tsc clean.
# xcodebuild test against iPhone 17 Pro failed because this Mac has no iOS 26.5
# simulator runtime after the freeze (`simctl list runtimes` is empty).  CI Mac
# runner compiles Swift.
```

## 5. Next Steps & Blockers

- Owner: update TestFlight after this lands to see the card.
- Web approval card still uses the compact `$200 → $202` line.  Same fields
  could be promoted there later.
- Existing pending proposals without `exitPlan` get the fallback note until
  the next strategy run.

## 6. Zero-Code Findings

None beyond the existing `docs/design/exit-strategy-intelligence.md` (exit
plumbing is strong; policy was still mostly a single stop/target).
