# Rollout Note: Coolify Host Caddy Repair & Header UI Verification

Date: 2026-07-30
Author: Antigravity

## 1. Context & Objective
The user reported two issues:
1. Server Stats panel on `socratictrade.com/admin/server` was showing a degraded/stale snapshot with HTTP 502 errors from `host.jays.services`.
2. Admin top bar had redundant elements (`Go Back` button on left, `ADMIN` badge, and `Server Stats` label next to app title).

## 2. Changes Made
- **Server Infrastructure (Caddy on Oracle Cloud `141.148.182.224`)**:
  - Updated `/etc/usage-monitor/Caddyfile` for `host.jays.services` to proxy to `coolify:8080` on the container bridge network rather than the stale/unreachable IP `100.97.154.2:8000`.
  - Removed `tls internal` to allow Caddy and Cloudflare edge proxying to manage public SSL certificates without 521/525 handshake errors.
  - Restarted `oracle-caddy-1` container to apply changes.
- **Admin Layout (`app/admin/layout.tsx`)**:
  - Verified that redundant header elements (`Go Back` link on left, `ADMIN` badge, and page title next to `HeaderLogo`) are already removed in current `main`. The header top bar displays only `HeaderLogo` (`SOCRATIC TRADE`) on the left and `Back to Console` + `ProfileMenu` avatar on the far right.

## 3. Decisions & Trade-offs
- `host.jays.services` must use `coolify:8080` within Caddy to allow internal container resolution while accepting external webhooks from GitHub for Coolify auto-deployments.

## 4. Verification State
- `curl -iv https://host.jays.services/api/v1/version` -> HTTP 401 (Valid Coolify API response via Cloudflare).
- `curl -iv https://host.jays.services/login` -> HTTP 302 / HTTP 200 (Coolify Dashboard accessible externally).
- `npx tsc --noEmit` -> Passed cleanly with 0 errors.

## 5. Next Steps & Blockers
- **Auto-Deploy Webhooks**: Now that `host.jays.services` responds cleanly, GitHub webhooks on push to `main` will automatically trigger Coolify deployments without manual queueing.
