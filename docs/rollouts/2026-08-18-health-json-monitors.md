# 2026-08-18 — Health JSON monitors, OPS token, R2 retain=1

## Context & Objective

UptimeRobot was paging on HTTP 200/503 of `/api/health`.  Scheduler silence,
silent trading-loop failure, and Litestream tier wedges must page on JSON
flags instead, without 503ing the Coolify liveness probe.  Also lock
`OPS_DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN` as the only ops secret and keep weekly R2 on the free
tier (retain 1).

## Changes Made

- `/api/health` always emits `checks.schedulerStale` (boolean),
  `checks.tradingLiveness.degraded` (count) plus `tradingLivenessDegraded`
  (boolean), and `checks.storage.litestreamTiersDegraded` (boolean).  Those
  flags never flip HTTP status.  pinecone / alpaca-broker stay critical.
  rag-embed degrade was not rewritten.
- `opsDiagnosticSecrets()` accepts only `OPS_DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN`.
  `ADMIN_REINDEX_TOKEN` is not a fallback.  Fetch script matches.
  This environment already has a working prod OPS token (64-char, snapshot
  HTTP 200).  Did not mint or rotate a second token.
- R2 weekly keep-generations is capped at 1.  Live Infisical name is
  `R2_ARCHIVE_KEEP_GENERATIONS` (host proof: process env is 2).  Code reads
  that name first, then the older `R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_RETAIN` alias, then
  defaults to 1, then `Math.min(..., 1)`.  Public
  `checks.storage.r2Weekly.keepGenerations` is always the capped value so a
  deploy can prove leftover env=2 is not honored.  Did not delete live R2
  objects (`cold-snapshots/app-2026-08-16.db`).  No Coolify/Infisical edits.
- Runbook: `docs/runbooks/uptime-health-json-monitors.md`.

Touched files:

- `app/api/health/route.ts`
- `app/api/ops/snapshot/route.ts`
- `src/lib/trading-liveness.ts`
- `src/lib/ops-auth.ts`

## Decisions & Trade-offs

- Kept `tradingLiveness.degraded` as a **count** (existing public contract).
  Added always-on `tradingLivenessDegraded` boolean so keyword monitors have a
  unique substring, matching the OpenRouter `"ok":false` pattern.
- Did not steal #2792 / #2798 / #2800 / #2794 (FilingAPI, alert-noise, Pinecone
  WU deadlock, iOS readiness).
- Did not change rag-embed criticality.

## Verification State

```bash
npx vitest run test/health-json-monitors.test.ts test/ops-snapshot.test.ts \
  test/r2-cold-snapshot.test.ts test/health-route-exposure.test.ts \
  test/trading-liveness.test.ts
# 5 files / 60 passed (7 new keep-generations cases)

npm run lint          # 0 errors (767 grandfathered warnings)
npx tsc --noEmit      # exit 0 after Record<string, string | undefined> env map
npm run build         # Next.js 16.3.1 webpack (re-run after keep-generations commit)
```

Focused health/ops/R2 tests are green.  A full `npm test` in this VM hit
unrelated env flakes (live SEC/Finnhub 404s, leftover `PUSHOVER_*` /
`siliconflow` keys in the shell).  Those files were not changed.  CI `verify`
is the authoritative full-suite gate.

## Next Steps & Blockers

Owner: create the three UptimeRobot keyword monitors from the runbook and
point them at Pushover.  Allow 4xx/5xx on those keyword monitors.  Leave the
HTTP 200 monitor as process-down only.  After merge, confirm
`checks.storage.r2Weekly.keepGenerations` is 1 while leftover Infisical
`R2_ARCHIVE_KEEP_GENERATIONS=2` remains (no Coolify edit).  Do not delete
`cold-snapshots/app-2026-08-16.db` from an agent.

## Zero-Code Findings

Live `https://socratictrade.com/api/health` was already HTTP 200.  Before this
PR, `schedulerStale` was omitted when healthy, `tradingLivenessDegraded` was
omitted when not degraded, and `litestreamTiersDegraded` was already present
as `false`.  Prod `/api/ops/snapshot` already accepted the cloud
`OPS_DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN` (ADMIN unset in this environment).  Host proof: live
process env is `R2_ARCHIVE_KEEP_GENERATIONS=2`, not 1.  Health `r2Weekly.key`
is `cold-snapshots/app-2026-08-16.db`.  The first pass only capped
`R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_RETAIN`, a name that is not set in production.
