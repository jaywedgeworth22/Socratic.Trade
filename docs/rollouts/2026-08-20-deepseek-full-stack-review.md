# 2026-08-20 — DEEPSEEK full-stack review: desktop web, mobile web, iOS

## 1. Context & Objective

Owner asked DEEPSEEK (new fleet seat) to run a top-to-bottom review of Socratic.Trade across the desktop website, the phone-width website, and the native iOS app, and to outline the fixes/improvements that can and should be made.  This is a review-only (zero-code) unit: the deliverable is a prioritized outline, board findings, and this paper trail.

## 2. Changes Made

- **New seat:** DEEPSEEK onboarded (tag `DEEPSEEK`, notes name DeepSeek, lane `~/apps/trading-deepseek`, branch prefix `deepseek/`).  Seat row added to `fleet-apps.json` and both `AGENT-SYNC.md` copies; landed via ai-fleet-coordinator PR #55 (merged).
- **Coordination:** board umbrella item `682e7e3467cd4def97a13ee67335cbb1` (claimed, in_progress); Slack intro + claim posted to #agent-sync; effort-log rows added (Planned/In Progress) to `/Users/jay/apps/TRADING-EFFORT-LOG.md` and `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`.
- **Review doc:** `docs/reviews/2026-08-20-deepseek-full-review.md` — live measurements, state verifications of open board findings, and the prioritized fix/improvement outline.
- **Touched files (lane):** `docs/reviews/2026-08-20-deepseek-full-review.md` (new), `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` (row), `STATUS.md` (row, this commit), `PLAN.md` (row, this commit).

## 3. Decisions & Trade-offs

- Review base = the clean lane at `origin/main` `41a7a438d`, NOT the dirty main worktree (`/Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade` has another agent's uncommitted work — left untouched).
- Findings already on the board (Kimi audit, MONET expert review) are referenced by id and verified against current main, not re-filed; state changes are recorded (89249c60 and 3b343933 look fixed on main; 830c892f, 410bda84, LIVE-02 confirmed open).
- No code changes made (zero-code review).  No production writes.

## 4. Verification State

- Live HTTP: root 307 → `/login`; strong security headers; CSP report-only; robots disallows all.
- Lighthouse: desktop perf 96 / a11y 100 / BP 96; mobile perf 66 / a11y 100 / BP 96 (LCP 8.3 s — 1 MB `icon.png` live, fixed in main by #2785 but not deployed).
- `/api/health`: live sha `e0a4959a`, 8 commits behind `origin/main` `41a7a438d`; scheduler healthy, 2 active accounts, `tradingLivenessDegraded: false`.
- Ruleset: only `verify` is a required check (ios-build is not).
- No local gates run (docs-only change; CI `verify` will run on the PR).

## 5. Next Steps & Blockers

- Land the docs PR (this branch) when CI is green.
- After the RTH latch window opens, confirm prod catches up (`bash scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh`) — 8 commits pending, incl. #2973/#2947/#2959/#2974/#2785/#2795.
- Claim the P1/P2 fixes from the outline per fleet process (board first): ios-build required check, CSP enforcement, 404 pages, privacy manifest, sign-in deep-link destination, board state updates for 89249c60/3b343933.

## 6. Zero-Code Findings (headlines)

1. Merge gate requires only `verify` — iOS never compiles in CI as a gate (board 830c892f confirmed).
2. Production 8 commits behind main; live login page still serves the 1 MB pre-crop icon (LCP 8.3 s mobile).
3. The entire public web surface is the sign-in page (root → /login, noindex, robots disallow all) — decision, not defect.
4. CSP is report-only with unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval — enforcement program is the one live-header gap.
5. No custom 404 pages; `/console/proposals` label/route mismatch renders Next's stock 404.
6. All three OAuth providers hardcode `redirectTo: "/"` — sign-in drops the deep-link destination (deepens 620ef423).
7. riskRules decoder fix and sign-out session clearing are on main — two open board findings need state updates.
8. iOS privacy manifest still absent (410bda84).
