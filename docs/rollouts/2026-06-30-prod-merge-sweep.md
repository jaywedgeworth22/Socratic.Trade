# 2026-06-30 - Production Merge Sweep

## Summary

Created `codex/prod-merge-sweep-20260630` from `origin/main` to merge pending
production-ready work into one deploy path:

- `codex/settings-help-overhaul` / PR #267 settings scope and field-help work.
- `codex/settings-review-polish` review-action placement and Settings UI polish.
- `codex/alpaca-held-order-guard` / PR #268, reconciled after it landed on
  `main` as squash commit `44466cbb`.
- `codex/market-scan-source-labels` / PR #269 source-label dedupe for Latest
  Decisions and Market Scan.

The sweep also fixes the two review blockers that were preventing a clean
production push:

- Broker orders that are filled at the broker but still have only a
  `pending_reconciliation` local fill row remain `pending_order`/Working in the
  unified feed instead of assuming a local `filled` event exists.
- Legacy Strategy Studio model choices are migrated into every connected
  account row before `user_settings.policy` is reduced to user-level fields.

## Why

The user asked to get all not-yet-merged/deployed work to production ASAP. These
branches were the relevant production-safe active deltas, but PR review threads
identified one broker-feed crash risk and one migration-data-loss risk. Both
needed to be fixed before deployment. PR #271 was left out because its diff
reintroduced inline model lists/settings churn and a simulated `$100` quote
fallback outside `NODE_ENV=test`; that conflicts with the current settings
direction and the no-fabricated-data rule.
