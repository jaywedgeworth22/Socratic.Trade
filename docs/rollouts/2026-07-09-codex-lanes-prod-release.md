# 2026-07-09 - Codex lanes production release

## Summary

Codex PR #1175 (Red Team efficacy Results card) and PR #1174 (LIVE bulk
typed-confirm approval flow) are now released to production.

## Why

The user asked Codex to continue until assigned work was deployed. MONET owned
the production release path for this handoff and verified Coolify deployment
`krk1db6x`, with production running `main@8bc0967f` exactly.

## Files

- `/Users/jay/apps/TRADING-EFFORT-LOG.md`
- `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-codex-lanes-prod-release.md`

## Verification

```bash
gh pr view 1175 --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit,statusCheckRollup
gh pr view 1174 --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit,statusCheckRollup
git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main
curl -sS -D - https://socratictrade.com/api/health -o /tmp/socratic-health.json
```

Results:

- PR #1175 merged to `main` as `9cc99963`; required `verify` and smoke checks passed.
- PR #1174 merged to `main` as `8bc0967f`; required `verify` and smoke checks passed.
- `origin/main` is `8bc0967f`.
- External production health returned HTTP 200 with `ok:true`, `db:"ok"`, and a recent scheduler tick.
- MONET posted terminal release proof in `#agent-sync`: Coolify deploy `krk1db6x`
  finished and production equals `main@8bc0967f` exactly.

## Follow-ups

- Continue with the next Codex-owned console parity slice from the effort board
  after auditing for stale rows created by MONET's UI sweep.
