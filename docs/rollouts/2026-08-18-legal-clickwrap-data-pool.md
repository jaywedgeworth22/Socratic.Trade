# 2026-08-18 — Legal clickwrap, mandatory data-pool, keep multi-user

## Context & Objective

Owner cut 2026-08-17 items 9–11 (from the blind-spots audit): ship a versioned
dismissible legal notice, make market-data pooling accept-or-cannot-use, and keep
Socratic.Trade multi-user-capable for friends/family.  One PR because the three
items share the consent/settings surfaces.  Do not sell ST.  Do not steal
#2792 / #2798 / #2800 / #2794.

## Changes Made

Combined first-use gate (web + iOS) records a versioned legal clickwrap and
mandatory data-pool accept.  After accept, the notice does not reappear until a
version bump.  Unset users no longer silently share.  `/welcome` stays on.
Privacy names self-serve deletion, 7-day backup TTL, and the shared RAG corpus.
Green/Red prompts carry the same “not investment advice / you set authority”
sentence (`agentic-strategy@2.11.0`).

## Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Mandatory share**, not default-share-all: `hasDataPoolConsent` is false until
  an explicit accept at `DATA_POOL_CONSENT_VERSION` (bumped to 2).  Decline is
  rejected by the API.  Settings shows required status, not an off toggle.
- **One blocking notice**, not a forever strip: owner asked for dismissible +
  no reappear after accept, versioned like Coach.  Accept is the dismiss.
- **Learned-context sharing stays optional.**  Only the market-data pool is
  mandatory.  Privacy still names the shared RAG/fact corpus.
- **Backup TTL** is the production Litestream snapshot retention (168h / 7 days
  in `litestream.coolify.yml`), not the older 48h R2 survival note.
- **`/welcome` stays reachable** by default (`landingPageEnabled` unset → true).
  Isolation for a second `ALLOWED_EMAILS` address is tested, not removed.
- No Stripe / IAP / paywall.

## Verification State

Commands run after the first push (see follow-up commit if anything failed):

```
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npx vitest run test/data-pool-consent.test.ts test/legal-notice-consent.test.ts test/per-user-policy-isolation.test.ts test/strategy-prompt-safety.test.ts test/dormant-features.test.ts test/settings-tree-scope.test.ts test/settings-search-index.test.ts
npm test
npm run build
```

iOS was edited; this Cloud VM cannot run `xcodebuild`.  First CI iOS job failed
because a new `LegalConsentSheet.swift` was not in the committed `.pbxproj`.
The sheet is now inlined in `SocraticTradeApp.swift`.

## Next Steps & Blockers

- Re-run iOS CI after the inline-sheet commit.  Existing production users
  (including the owner) will see the gate once on next visit because unset/v1
  records no longer count as current-version accept.
- Counsel-drafted Terms/Privacy still not in this PR — copy is product-legal,
  not a lawyer pass.
- Leave #2792 / #2798 / #2800 / #2794 to their owners.

## Zero-Code Findings

None.  This is the implementation of the 2026-08-17 owner cut.
