# 2026-07-04 — Slack coordination sync, on by default for all sessions/repos (Monet)

## Summary
Makes the two-Claude Slack coordination (Monet = cloud, Fable = local Mac) work
**by default in every Claude Code session and every repo**, without the flaky
Slack MCP connector. Ships a curl-based engine, a global `SessionStart` hook
installer, cloud wiring, and an owner/Fable guide.

Branch `claude/slack-sync-default-setup` (off `origin/main` @ `c2ee3f0`).

## What changed
- **`scripts/slack-sync.sh`** (new, engine) — MCP-independent Slack Web API wrapper.
  Subcommands `read` / `thread` / `post` / `reply` / `test` / `hook`. Safety model:
  - No `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` -> every subcommand is a **silent no-op, exit 0** (the note
    goes to stderr, so the `hook` path injects *nothing* into a token-less session).
  - Token passed to `curl` via a `0600` temp `--config` file — never on `argv`
    (invisible to `ps`), never echoed/logged.
  - Fetched content wrapped in an `UNTRUSTED EXTERNAL DATA` envelope.
  - JSON via `jq` -> `python3` -> `sed/grep` fallback; pure ASCII (Mac bash 3.2).
  - `hook` subcommand: SessionStart context injection with a how-to header; it is
    **self-de-duplicating** per session (reads `session_id` from the hook's stdin
    JSON and claims a marker) so a global + repo hook can't double-inject.
- **`scripts/setup-slack-sync.sh`** (new, installer) — idempotent global install:
  copies the engine to `~/.claude/slack-sync.sh` and **merges** (never clobbers) a
  `SessionStart` hook into `~/.claude/settings.json` via a python3 JSON merge that
  preserves existing keys/hooks and upgrades the slack entry in place on re-run.
- **`scripts/cloud-setup.sh`** — now calls the installer (non-fatal) so any cloud
  environment pointed at it gets the hook automatically.
- **`docs/slack-coordination.md`** (new) — full setup: token as env secret (Mac
  export vs cloud Runtime Secret), install command, bot scopes
  (`channels:history` / `channels:read` / `chat:write`) + `/invite`, verify steps,
  everyday usage, and FAQ (incl. "renaming the channel is safe — calls key on the
  channel **ID** `C0BEZDJDNKV`, not the name").

## Why
The Slack MCP connector flapped, breaking coordination. A bot-token + curl wrapper
fired from a global `SessionStart` hook is reliable and dependency-free. `.claude/`
is intentionally git-ignored in this repo, so a committed per-repo hook is the wrong
vehicle *and* only covers one repo — the owner asked for **all** repos/sessions, so
the mechanism is a global `~/.claude/settings.json` hook (+ cloud setup step),
installed by a committed script.

## Verification
- `bash -n` clean on all three scripts; `grep -nP '[^\x00-\x7F]'` = pure ASCII;
  `$VAR`-adjacency check clean.
- `slack-sync.sh`: no-token `hook` prints nothing on stdout (exit 0), stderr note
  present; `help` works token-less; unknown subcommand exits 2. With a stubbed
  `curl`: `hook` injects header+envelope, a 2nd same-session run is silent (dedup),
  `read` shows the envelope, `post` returns ok.
- `setup-slack-sync.sh` in a sandbox `HOME`: merges the hook, **preserves** an
  unrelated `model` key, an unrelated SessionStart hook, and a `PreToolUse` hook;
  re-run leaves exactly **one** slack entry (idempotent).
- No TypeScript/app code changed, so the `verify` trio (tsc/test/build) is
  unaffected; `npx tsc --noEmit` run as a guard.

## Follow-on commits (same PR #367)
- `docs`: local secrets-file example renamed `slack-monet.env` -> `agent-sync.env` (owner rename).
- `slack-sync.sh`: added the **`test`** subcommand (auth.test; the docs referenced it but it was
  missing) and relabeled cosmetics `#claude-monet-sync` -> `#agent-sync` + the other instance
  `Fable` -> `Claude` (owner: the local Mac instance now uses the "Claude" tag; channel renamed,
  ID unchanged). Live-verified against the owner's workspace: `test` -> `ok:true`, bot
  `agent-sync-realtime` (`U0BF7MEDJ9X`); the curl engine and the local realtime push integration
  share one bot and are complementary.
- `scripts/agent-sync-bootstrap.sh` (new): **self-contained** single-file installer that embeds the
  engine (no sibling dependency) for repos that cannot read this one (e.g. the `congress.trade`
  Cloudflare Worker). Generated from `slack-sync.sh` + `setup-slack-sync.sh`; sandbox-verified.

## Env standardization (owner request)
- **`AGENT_NAME` -> `SLACK_AGENT_NAME`** (old var still honored as a fallback).
- **`SLACK_TOPIC`** project filter: when set, `read`/`thread`/`hook` show only that project's
  `[TOPIC]` messages + `[FLEET]`/`[ALL]` broadcasts, and `post`/`reply` auto-prefix `[TOPIC]`;
  topic reads fetch a wider window (`SLACK_TOPIC_FETCH_LIMIT`, default 100). Filtering across all
  three tiers (jq/python3/sed), verified. Canonical tags: `Socratic.Trade`, `Congress.Trade`,
  `API-Usage-Monitor`, `Congress-Trading-Shared`. One shared channel, per-lane views; a project can
  still split to its own channel later via `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` with no code change.
- **"Talk in shorthand, not prose"** rule (owner does not read the channel) documented in
  `docs/slack-coordination.md` and made durable in `AGENTS.md` (Agent Slack coordination section).
- `scripts/agent-sync-bootstrap.sh` regenerated from the updated engine.
- Announced the standardization to the local **Claude** instance on `#agent-sync` (posted via the
  new `SLACK_TOPIC=Socratic.Trade` + `SLACK_AGENT_NAME=Monet` path -> rendered
  `[Socratic.Trade] [Monet] ...`).

## Owner actions
- **Token is now live in the Monet cloud env** (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`), so Monet
  posts to `#agent-sync` from cloud (verified). Optionally add `AGENT_NAME=Monet` for auto-prefix.
- **congress.trade (separate repo, out of this session's GitHub scope):** drop
  `scripts/agent-sync-bootstrap.sh` into it; cloud setup script = its deps step + `bash
  scripts/agent-sync-bootstrap.sh`; add `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0BEZDJDNKV` secrets.
- **Coordination open item:** asked the local **Claude** instance which global `~/.claude`
  SessionStart hook is canonical (its "always-enable" mechanism vs `setup-slack-sync.sh`) to avoid
  double-wiring on the Mac; the `hook` per-session dedup covers its own entry only.

## Follow-ups / owner actions (original)
- **Cloud env:** add `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` as a **Runtime Secret**; point the env setup
  script at `bash scripts/cloud-setup.sh` (or add `bash scripts/setup-slack-sync.sh`).
  This cloud container currently has **no** `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, so Monet cannot post
  to Slack from here until that secret exists.
- **Local Mac (Fable):** `export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=...` where Claude Code sees it, then
  `bash scripts/setup-slack-sync.sh` once. Both machines: `/invite` the bot + grant
  the three scopes.
- **Security:** any raw `xoxb`/`xoxp` token pasted into chat/files earlier must be
  **rotated** in Slack. Keep the token an env secret only — never committed.
