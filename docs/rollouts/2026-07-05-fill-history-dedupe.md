# Rollout Note: Fill History Deduplication

## Summary
Optimized Socratic Trade's strategy execution loop by prefetching live and paper fills once at the start of the strategy run (`runStrategyOnce`) and threading the pre-cached fills into downstream scorecard, validation, and sizing functions in `src/lib/performance.ts` and `src/lib/strategy.ts`.

## Why
Previously, the scorecard functions `getSectorScorecard`, `getThesisRegimeScorecard`, `getClosedLotCount`, `getSignalEfficacy`, `getFactorScorecard`, and `getConfidenceCalibration` independently executed SQLite queries to fetch fills. Since these scorecards are generated multiple times to assemble prompt context and perform deterministic sizing/validation during each strategy iteration, this resulted in 7-9x redundant fetch queries per strategy run/request. Prefetching once and threading the `PrefetchedFills` cache through downstream functions eliminates these redundant database calls, significantly improving latency and reducing SQLite I/O load.

## Files Touched
- [`src/lib/performance.ts`](file:///Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade/src/lib/performance.ts): Updated scorecard functions to accept optional `prefetched?: PrefetchedFills` parameter and delegate database querying to the `fillsForSource` cache-aware helper.
- [`src/lib/strategy.ts`](file:///Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade/src/lib/strategy.ts): Prefetched fills once inside `runStrategyOnce` and passed the pre-cached fills payload down through `shouldSkipNegativeExpectancy`, `applyDeterministicSizing`, and `proposeTrades` context scorecard generators.
- [`test/performance.test.ts`](file:///Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade/test/performance.test.ts): Added a new unit test suite targeting `PrefetchedFills` optimization to guarantee that supplying prefetched fills successfully bypasses database `listFillEvents` queries.
- [`docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`](file:///Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade/docs/EFFORT-LOG.md): Updated the repository effort log mirror to move this item to "In Progress" with branch details.

## Verification
The following validation commands were run successfully with zero errors:
1. **Linting check**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   *Result*: 0 errors.

2. **TypeScript validation**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   *Result*: Clean compilation (0 errors).

3. **Performance unit tests**:
   ```bash
   npx vitest run test/performance.test.ts
   ```
   *Result*: All 35 tests passed successfully, including the new `PrefetchedFills` database bypass assertion.

4. **Strategy tuning tests**:
   ```bash
   npx vitest run test/strategy-tuning.test.ts
   ```
   *Result*: 14/14 tests passed successfully.

5. **Full production build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   *Result*: Next.js production build succeeded with clean static generation and typechecking.

## Follow-ups
None. The optimization has been fully implemented, covered by a dedicated regression/unit test, and verified clean against the Next.js compilation/build process.
