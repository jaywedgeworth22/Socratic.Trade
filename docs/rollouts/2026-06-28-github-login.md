# 2026-06-28 - GitHub login

## Summary
- Added conditional GitHub OAuth sign-in alongside Google through Auth.js.
- Updated the login page to render every configured Auth.js provider instead of hardcoding Google.
- Required GitHub to return a verified email through the `user:email` scope before accepting sign-in.
- Kept app identity email-based, so Google and GitHub sign-ins with the same verified email map to the same app account.
- Updated account-deletion copy, auth docs, env docs, and focused identity/middleware tests.

## Why
The app already derives users from normalized verified email. Adding GitHub should therefore use the same identity primitive rather than introducing a second provider-account identity model. That gives same-email Google/GitHub account continuity now, while leaving a future `user_identities` table for provider-account-id linking if private relay or non-email identity becomes first-class.

## Verification
- `npm ci` (installed dependencies for this isolated worktree; npm reported two existing moderate audit findings and pending install-script approvals).
- `npx tsc --noEmit` - clean.
- `npx vitest run test/auth-identity.test.ts test/middleware-auth.test.ts` - 2 files / 22 tests passed.
- `npm test` - 155 files / 1,495 tests passed.
- `npm run build` - passed; existing Next.js middleware-to-proxy deprecation warning only.
- Local smoke with dummy provider envs on `http://127.0.0.1:4126`: `/login` rendered both `Sign in with Google` and `Sign in with GitHub`; `/api/auth/providers` returned both provider IDs and callback URLs.

## Follow-ups
- Set `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` and `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` in production before expecting the GitHub button to appear live.
- A future provider-account-id table can link accounts even when provider emails differ; this change intentionally links only same verified email plus configured primary aliases.
