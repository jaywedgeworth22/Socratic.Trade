# 2026-07-05 Usage Monitor Metrics

## Summary
Added telemetry event pushing for broker account balances and limits to track tech account caps/credits accurately via the API Usage Monitor.

## Why
Socratic.Trade needs to be able to monitor the total available limits and account balances to properly handle capital limits across Robinhood and Alpaca without exceeding risk barriers or API limits.

## Files
- `src/lib/usage-monitor-push.ts`
- `src/lib/alpaca.ts`
- `src/lib/robinhood.ts`

## Verification
- `npm run lint` (passed)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` (passed)
- `npm test` (2650 tests passed)
- `npm run build` encountered local cache locks (`ENOENT pages-manifest.json`), but code was verified via unit tests and typing.

## Follow-ups
- Ensure the newly exported API Usage Monitor properly handles the `"balance"` and `"limit"` metricTypes coming from Socratic.Trade.
