# 2026-07-18 — PR #1735 verify cleanup

## Summary

Merged `origin/main` into `agent/ag-recovery-v48-migration` and fixed the hosted `verify` failures
left on PR #1735.

## Why

The branch canonicalizes OpenRouter telemetry to bare model IDs for usage and benchmark persistence,
but four existing tests still expected provider-qualified served-model attribution such as
`openai/gpt-4.1-mini` and `google/gemini-2.5-flash`. GitHub Actions failed on those assertions.

## Files

- `test/llm-provider-cooldown.test.ts`
- `test/strategy-llm-failover.test.ts`
- `test/persistence-notification.test.ts`
- `test/strategy-money-path-f-g.test.ts`
- `STATUS.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`

## Verification

Passed:

```bash
npm test -- test/llm-provider-cooldown.test.ts test/strategy-llm-failover.test.ts test/persistence-notification.test.ts test/strategy-money-path-f-g.test.ts
```

Result: 4 files passed, 34 tests passed.

## Follow-ups

Let PR #1735 hosted `verify` rerun on the pushed branch and use the full gate as the merge arbiter.

## Round 2 review cleanup

Resolved two fresh Codex review comments on PR #1735:

- Preserved `companyName` display casing in `src/lib/db-securities-import.ts`; ticker normalization
  remains uppercase, but imported names such as `Tesla` no longer pass through the ticker-oriented
  shared `clean()` helper.
- Regenerated `package-lock.json` with `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --no-audit
  --no-fund`, restoring the peer dependency entries needed by `@langfuse/otel` and webpack so clean
  installs no longer re-resolve/fail on missing lock entries.

Additional verification:

```bash
npm ci --dry-run --ignore-scripts
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
npm test -- test/securities-import.test.ts
```

Result: clean-install dry-run passed; focused securities import suite passed, 17/17 tests.

## Round 3 review cleanup

Resolved the OpenRouter proposal attribution card mismatch issue (Codex review comment):
- Exported and integrated `normalizeModelId` in `app/console/components/approval-card.tsx` to strip routing and vendor prefixes before comparing `p.proposedByModel` against configured primary or fallbacks.
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `test/approvals-triage-model.test.ts` to verify prefix stripping works under all standard scenarios.

Additional verification:

```bash
npx vitest run test/approvals-triage-model.test.ts
```

Result: all 4 tests passed, including `normalizeModelId` tests.

## Round 4 — proposed-model attribution P2

### Summary

Separated proposal-attribution identity from telemetry canonicalization. `TradeProposal.proposedByModel`
now retains the exact configured primary/fallback identifier, including the `openrouter/` namespace.

### Why

Usage/benchmark aggregation correctly canonicalizes an OpenRouter route such as
`openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-flash` to a bare model identity. The proposal writer had reused that
telemetry value, but approval-card provenance compares persisted proposal identity directly to
`policy.llmModel` and `policy.llmFallbackModels`. The mismatch falsely labelled a configured primary
as different and concealed a configured fallback.

### Files

- `src/lib/strategy.ts`
- `test/strategy-llm-failover.test.ts`
- `test/strategy-money-path-f-g.test.ts`
- `STATUS.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`

### Verification

Passed:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npx eslint src/lib/strategy.ts test/strategy-llm-failover.test.ts test/strategy-money-path-f-g.test.ts
npx vitest run test/strategy-llm-failover.test.ts --reporter=dot
npx vitest run test/strategy-money-path-f-g.test.ts -t 'books a broker-paper fill' --reporter=dot
```

The strategy fixture creates a fresh SQLite database and replays migrations 2–52 per test. Under
shared-machine load, its normal explicit 30-second test limits expired during migration setup, so
the two focused verification commands used a temporary local-only 90-second timeout patch; the
committed tests retain their normal 30-second limits. Both regression paths passed: OpenRouter
fallback identity and OpenRouter primary identity respectively.

### Follow-up

Push the branch back to PR #1735 after both review fixes are in place, then reply and resolve the
remaining review thread with the verification evidence.
