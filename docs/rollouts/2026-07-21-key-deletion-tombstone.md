## Executive Summary

Resolved the issue where deleted API keys (specifically Gemini and DeepSeek) re-appeared in the Socratic.Trade UI on server startup/restart. 

### Root Cause
`instrumentation.ts` calls `migrateLocalEnvCredentials()` during Next.js server startup. `migrateLocalEnvCredentials()` iterates through `LOCAL_ENV_MIGRATION_SERVICES` (`"gemini"`, `"deepseek"`, `"openai"`, `"anthropic"`, etc.) and checks if a per-user key exists for `LOCAL_USER`. Previously, `deleteUserApiKey` executed a SQL `DELETE FROM user_api_keys`, completely wiping the database row. On the next server startup, `migrateLocalEnvCredentials()` saw `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` in the environment and `!getUserApiKey(LOCAL_USER, "gemini")` as `true`, and re-seeded `GEMINI_API_KEY` into `user_api_keys`, making deleted keys re-appear in the UI.

### Fix
1. **Tombstone Support:** Updated `deleteUserApiKey` in `src/lib/db-api-keys.ts` for `LOCAL_ENV_MIGRATION_SERVICES` to store a tombstone row (`apiKey = "__DELETED__"`, `label = "deleted by user"`).
2. **Resolver Fail-Closed:** Updated `getUserApiKey`, `resolveApiKeyWithSource`, `resolveLlmCredential`, and `listUserApiKeys` to handle `__DELETED__`:
   - `listUserApiKeys`: Filters out tombstone rows so the UI accurately displays `configured: false`.
   - `getUserApiKey`: By default returns `undefined` when `apiKey === "__DELETED__"`, but supports `{ includeDeleted: true }`.
   - `resolveApiKeyWithSource` & `resolveLlmCredential`: Detect the tombstone row and immediately return `{ source: "none" }` (fail closed without falling back to operator environment keys).
   - `migrateLocalEnvCredentials`: Checks `getUserApiKey(LOCAL_USER, svc, { includeDeleted: true })`. Since the tombstone row exists, it recognizes that the user explicitly deleted the key and refrains from re-seeding it from process environment variables.
   - Infisical ST Primary Bridge (`st-primary-bridge-writer.ts`): Detects tombstone rows and marks status as `"revoked"`.
3. **Shared Infra Preserved:** Shared infrastructure services (e.g. `finnhub`) continue to hard-delete rows on `deleteUserApiKey` so they fall back to global environment keys as intended for shared tier resources.

## Changed Files

- `src/lib/db-api-keys.ts`: Implemented tombstone writing in `deleteUserApiKey` and tombstone-aware checks in `getUserApiKey`, `listUserApiKeys`, `resolveApiKeyWithSource`, `resolveLlmCredential`, and `migrateLocalEnvCredentials`.
- `src/lib/st-primary-bridge-writer.ts`: Added tombstone handling in `desiredEntries()` to report status `"revoked"`.
- `app/layout.tsx`: Fixed empty string `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` handling in `metadataBase` to prevent `TypeError: Invalid URL`.
- `test/key-resolution-tiering.test.ts`: Added automated unit test verifying that deleting `gemini` or `deepseek` keys prevents `migrateLocalEnvCredentials` from re-seeding them on server restarts.
- `STATUS.md`, `/Users/jay/apps/TRADING-EFFORT-LOG.md`, `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`: Documentation updates.
