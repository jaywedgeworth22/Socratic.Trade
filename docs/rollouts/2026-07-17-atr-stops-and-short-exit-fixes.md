# Rollout Note: ATR Stop & Short cover-buy fixes

## Summary
Fixed two bugs flagged by automated Codex review comments on PR #1705:
1. Passed `input.candidateAtrStopPctBySymbol` into `compactMarketScanForPrompt` so that candidate stop distances are actually included when constructing Green Team prompts.
2. Switched from inline `exitSide/side` order filtering to the centralized `isLiveExitOrder` helper when filtering open exit orders, ensuring Alpaca `buy` side orders covering short positions are correctly identified as active protection.

## Why
1. In PR #1705, the computed candidate ATR stop percentages were fetched but omitted when calling `compactMarketScanForPrompt`, causing candidates to lack stop-distance data in Green Team prompts.
2. Alpaca maps short-closing order side to `"buy"` rather than `"cover"`, so filtering by `exitSide = "cover"` for shorts missed these open exit orders, falsely marking positions as unprotected and causing redundant proposed exits.
