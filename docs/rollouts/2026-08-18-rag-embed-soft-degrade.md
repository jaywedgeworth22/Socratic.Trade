# 2026-08-18 — rag-embed soft-degrade (no 503 / no autonomy halt)

## Context & Objective

A hard-stopped `rag-embed` lane 503'd `/api/health`.  Coolify treats that as container death, restarts Docker, and the boot interlock re-halts Green/Red.  One dead embed must degrade that lane only — like OpenRouter credits — without taking down the app, the embed queue, or autonomy.  `pinecone` and `alpaca-broker` stay critical.  Did not steal #2792/#2798/#2800/#2794.

## Changes Made

- `/api/health` no longer adds `rag-embed` / `rag-rerank` to `criticalServices`.  A hard-stopped embed/rerank lane is reported `ok: false` + `degraded: true` and the probe stays HTTP 200.  Pinecone and Alpaca still 503 the probe.
- `storeContexts` isolates a thrown document-embed call to that batch.  Later batches still embed and upsert.  Managed commits still require every chunk (`documentComplete` stays false if any batch died).
- Query embed now returns null on a thrown provider call (same contract as a malformed vector).  Retrieval fail-opens; Green/Red already skip RAG on `lookup_failed`.

Touched files:

- `src/lib/vector-db.ts`
- `test/connection-health-routing.test.ts`
- `test/vector-db-embedding-integrity.test.ts`

- `docs/phase-7-strategy.md`
- `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-rag-embed-soft-degrade.md`

## Decisions & Trade-offs

- Demoted both `rag-embed` and `rag-rerank`.  The user named rag-embed; rerank already fail-opens and the same 503 would restart Docker.  Critical set is now only `pinecone` + `alpaca-broker`.
- Did not touch FilingAPI (#2792/#2798), Pinecone 15-WU remainder (#2800), or iOS (#2794).
- Integrity still rejects the poisoned batch (no upsert of malformed vectors).  The old `break` that parked later batches is now `continue`.
- Lease loss still throws.  That is a concurrency boundary, not a provider outage.

## Verification State

Focused tests pending in this note's follow-up; commands actually run will be recorded after the local gate.

## Next Steps & Blockers

- Land this PR.  After merge, confirm live `/api/health` stays 200 with a dead embed lane and that Coolify does not restart.
- No owner action required.  Do not raise the Pinecone WU fuse.  Do not steal the reserved PRs.

## Zero-Code Findings

The Docker/autonomy kill path was health-only: five consecutive hard `rag-embed` rows → `ok=false` → HTTP 503 → Coolify restart → `autonomy_halted_on_boot` unless `autoResumeOnBoot`.  Scheduler/strategy auto-halt only on broker health, not RAG.  SEC ingest already isolates per task.  Query retrieval already had an outer fail-open catch; the remaining gap was a thrown embed aborting later store batches and 503ing the probe.
