# 2026-09-09 — Backup methodology: policy, archive depth, whole-attempt bounds, proven restore

## Context & Objective

The owner asked to "fix the backup methodology/procedures for ST".  PR #3192 (merged
2026-09-08T12:03Z) had just fixed the *mechanism* of the weekly cold archive — better-sqlite3
`backup()` replaced with `VACUUM INTO` in a child process.  This lane audited the whole backup
estate end to end, wrote the policy down, closed the highest-value gaps, and — the point of the
whole exercise — **actually restored a backup and checked it**.

Three things were expected going in.  All three turned out to be wrong in the owner's favour or
against it, and each is evidenced below rather than asserted:

- "A fresh cold snapshot should be landing now that #3192 is deployed."  **It is not.**
- "Backblaze is at ~535 GB and growing ~45 GB/day; propose a prune."  **No longer true.**
- "No evidence a restore has ever been tested."  **One was, on 2026-08-18.**  Also: a *fourth*
  backup tier exists that was not in the brief, it is broken, and it is broken by the exact root
  cause #3192 fixed one layer up.

## Verified current state — read live 2026-09-09

### Tier 1 — Litestream to Backblaze B2: HEALTHY

`/api/health` `checks.storage`: `litestreamStatus: replicating`, `litestreamDegradedReasons: []`,
tier 0 `ageSeconds: 1`, `litestreamTiersDegraded: false`.  Tiers 2/3 read stale (7 days) and are
*correctly* not degraded — `litestream.coolify.yml` deliberately configures a single compaction
level, which turns L2/L3 off.

`rclone size` against B2:

| Prefix | Objects | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `jays-socratic-trade-eu/trading-live/` | 5,910 | 56.343 GiB |
| `jays-socratic-trade-eu/hetzner/` | 8 | 34.236 GiB |
| **bucket total** | 5,918 | **90.579 GiB** |

**Correction to the fleet's shared understanding:** the PITR window is **7 days, not 30**.  The
`retention: 720h` figure lives in `litestream.yml`, a local-dev file pointing at
`/Users/jay/apps/trading-live/data/app.db` — a path that exists on no current machine.  The
production config is `litestream.coolify.yml`, `retention: 168h`.

### Tier 3 — weekly cold archive to Cloudflare R2: STILL NOT ADVANCING

`objectCount = 1`, `payloadSize = 9,679,310,848`, sole key `cold-snapshots/app-2026-08-30.db`
(Cloudflare R2 analytics API, window ending 2026-09-09T14:00Z; independently confirmed by a live
`ListObjectsV2` from inside the production container).  `r2Weekly.ok = false`,
`ageSeconds = 902823` (10.4 days), `reason: archive_stale`.

#3192 worked, and then exposed the next fault.  From `due_jobs` and `audit_events`:

| Evidence | Value |
|---|---|
| `week-2026-09-06` | `status = unresolvable`, `attempts = 31`, `last_error = "fetch failed"` |
| Last `r2_cold_snapshot.start` | 2026-09-08T15:36:14Z |
| First-ever `r2_cold_snapshot.error` | 2026-09-08T15:47:24Z — `"fetch failed"`, `durationMs 670094` |
| `r2_cold_snapshot.success` | 5 lifetime, newest still 2026-08-30T03:30:17Z |
| `r2coldsnap:lastFailure` | `cold-snapshots/app-2026-09-08.db.gz`, reason `fetch failed` |

So the snapshot step now completes — that is #3192 working — and the run then died in the
**upload**, which #3192 did not bound, with a bare `fetch failed` and no recoverable detail.  The
job then exhausted its attempt budget (30 of those 31 attempts were the old hang re-claiming an
expired lease, not real failures) and went terminally `unresolvable`.

Three distinct defects, all fixed here:

1. **`withSnapshotDeadline` wrapped only the snapshot step** (line 775 pre-change).  A hung
   upload had no bound short of the 2 h lease expiring — the same silent-restart shape #3192 set
   out to end.
2. **A single transient failure discarded the whole attempt**, including the ~11 minutes of
   `VACUUM INTO` that produced the artifact.  There was no retry on any S3 request.
3. **`err.message` was recorded.**  Node's `fetch` collapses every transport failure into the
   literal string `fetch failed` and hides the reason in `error.cause`, so production recorded
   nothing classifiable.

### Tier 2 — host-side 6-hourly SQLite dumps: BROKEN.  Not in this repo.

This tier was not in the brief.  It exists, it is real coverage, and it is down.

- `/data/backups/socratic/` holds exactly **one** dump,
  `socratic-app-20260906T121501Z.db` (10,607,546,368 bytes), finished 2026-09-07T11:59Z.
  Retention asks for two.  Nothing since.
- That dump took **~23.7 hours**.  It is `sqlite3 "$src" ".backup '$dest'"` against the live
  volume — **the same online-backup API whose page-1 restart loop #3192 diagnosed one layer up**.
- Every 6-hourly tick from 2026-09-07T18:15Z to 2026-09-09T12:15Z logged
  `SKIP already running (lock held)` because the previous run still held the `flock`.
- The hardened script installed 2026-09-08T03:24Z bounds the dump at `FLEET_BACKUP_TIMEOUT=30m`.
  A copy that takes ~24 h is now killed at 30 minutes, its output deleted, and the function
  `return 0`s — **failing silently, forever, on every tick**, with no alert path.
- `fleet-backup-verify-weekly.sh` already caught this once: on 2026-09-06 it reported
  `FAIL socratic integrity` / `Error: in prepare, file is not a database (26)`.  That went to
  `/var/log/fleet-backup/cron-weekly.log` and nowhere else.

The fix is one word — `.backup` to `VACUUM INTO` — but the script lives at
`/usr/local/sbin/fleet-sqlite-backup.sh` on the host, which is fleet-ops territory, and
production is read-only to this lane.  Filed for the owner in `docs/backup-policy.md` §8.1 with
the exact change.

### Backblaze growth: the ~535 GB board figure is stale

Re-measured rather than assumed.  All three `hetzner/` prefixes together are **41.280 GiB**
across 18 objects (socratic 34.236, congress 5.055, usage-monitor 1.989), unchanged when B2 file
versions are included.  The `B2_KEEP_SETS` prune added 2026-08-31 fixed it.  **No deletion is
proposed and none is needed.**

### Restore proof: one, on 2026-08-18, never repeated

`docs/rollouts/2026-08-17-litestream-restore-drill.md` records a real B2 restore to scratch:
4.9 GB, 107 s, `integrity_check` ok, row counts compared.  It was manual, it was three weeks ago,
and the database has since **more than doubled** to 10.98 GB.  `scripts/litestream-restore-drill.sh`
— the script that would repeat it — was unrunnable: it defaulted to a Mac path that exists on no
current machine and described the replica as R2, which it has not been since #2584.

## Changes Made

### Policy

- **`docs/backup-policy.md` (new, canonical).**  Four tiers with cadence, retention, RPO, RTO;
  why the two-provider split exists and must not be optimised away; an explicit **what is NOT
  covered** section; verification cadences; per-tier alerting; restore runbooks; the open owner
  decisions with numbers.

### Cold archive (`src/lib/r2-cold-snapshot.ts`)

- **Archive depth 1 → 4.**  Depth one means a single object *is* the entire archive tier.  The 1
  was a free-tier cap; paid R2 is enabled.  Also removed the clamp that made
  `R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_RETAIN` **write-only in the up direction** (`min(env, DEFAULT)`), replacing it
  with a real `MAX_RETAIN = 12` ceiling.  A useful side effect: at retain 4 the legacy 9.68 GB
  `app-2026-08-30.db` is simply **kept**, so no deletion approval is needed and the
  `SKIP_PRUNE` workaround becomes moot.
- **Pre-upload artifact verification.**  The snapshot child now runs `PRAGMA integrity_check` on
  the copy it just made and counts rows in `audit_events`, `trade_proposals`,
  `portfolio_snapshots`, `connected_accounts`, `settings`, `llm_usage` — in both the live source
  and the copy — and the run **refuses to upload** unless integrity is `ok` and every table that
  is populated live is populated in the copy.  A structurally perfect *empty* database passes
  `integrity_check` and is worthless as a backup, which is why the second assertion exists.
  Exact row equality is deliberately not required: the live DB is written continuously.
  "Reached the upload unverified" is not a reachable state — a snapshot impl that reports nothing
  falls back to a real verification child.
- **Whole-attempt deadline** (`R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_ATTEMPT_DEADLINE_MIN`, default 90 min, under the
  2 h lease), threaded as an `AbortSignal` into every S3 request so an over-deadline upload is
  genuinely **aborted** rather than left running against a job whose lease has moved on.
- **Bounded per-request retries** (3 by default, retryable statuses and transport errors only,
  short-circuited once the attempt deadline fires).  Part bodies are already buffered, so a retry
  re-sends the same bytes and part numbering never shifts.
- **`describeRequestError`** unwraps the `cause` chain, so the next `fetch failed` arrives as
  `fetch failed <- read ECONNRESET (ECONNRESET)` in the audit row, Sentry, and `lastFailure`.

### Restore verification

- **`scripts/ops/verify-cold-snapshot-restore.mjs` (new).**  Downloads the newest
  `cold-snapshots/` object, gunzips it in-stream, opens it with the same SQLite driver production
  uses, `integrity_check`s it, asserts the key tables are populated, writes a JSON receipt, and
  discards the scratch copy.  Exit 3 means *not provably restorable*.  Read-only against R2 with
  no DELETE path of any kind.
- **`scripts/litestream-restore-drill.sh` repointed** at the production paths and the B2 replica,
  with a free-space precheck, an explicit bucket/endpoint echo against the documented
  same-object-path footgun, the same six key tables, and a real non-zero exit on failure (it
  previously printed a warning and exited 0).

## Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Retain 4, not 8 or 52.**  Four gzipped weeklies is about a month of archive history at ~12 GB
  of paid R2.  Cheap enough not to need a conversation, deep enough that no single fault empties
  the tier.  The ceiling is 12 so a fat-fingered env cannot pin hundreds of multi-GB objects.
- **Verification in the snapshot child, not a separate pass.**  The child already has the file
  open and the source connection live; verifying there costs one extra `integrity_check` and six
  `COUNT(*)`s, and it happens while the artifact is still local and cheap to throw away.
- **The round-trip restore drill is a script, not a durable in-app job.**  Downloading ~10 GB and
  integrity-checking it inside the trading container on a schedule is real CPU, IO, and disk
  pressure on a live-money box.  A documented monthly script with a receipt is the right ratio
  until someone wants to pay for it continuously.
- **`R2_COLD_SNAPSHOT_SKIP_PRUNE` kept, not removed.**  It is inert at retain 4 and is still the
  right escape hatch if retention is ever lowered again.
- **No deletion of anything, anywhere.**  No R2 object, no B2 object, no host backup.  The one
  file this lane's tooling removes is the scratch copy the restore drill itself creates.
- **Production stayed read-only.**  No restart, no deploy, no env change, no host script edit.
  The tier-2 breakage is documented and handed to the owner rather than fixed in place.

## Verification State

```
npx tsc --noEmit                              # clean
npx vitest run test/r2-cold-snapshot.test.ts  # 59 passed (19 new)
npx eslint src/lib/r2-cold-snapshot.ts test/r2-cold-snapshot.test.ts   # clean
```

New tests cover: retention raising as well as lowering and the `MAX_RETAIN` ceiling; the
verification verdict in all four shapes (pass, missing report, bad integrity, structurally sound
but empty table); no-assertion-on-absent-live-table; unparseable child output; the real
child-process `VACUUM INTO` reporting integrity plus live-and-copy row counts; the standalone
verifier rejecting a non-database; `describeRequestError` unwrapping a cause chain; and, on the
drain path, that a failed verification uploads **zero bytes**, that a transient part failure is
retried to success, that retries are bounded, and that a hung **upload** now fails with
`attempt_deadline_exceeded` inside its own lease.

### Restore actually proven

A real round trip was run against production R2 on 2026-09-09 using the new script.
**PASS.**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "key": "cold-snapshots/app-2026-08-30.db",
  "objectBytes": 9679310848,
  "restoredBytes": 9679310848,
  "integrity": "ok",
  "tables": {
    "audit_events": 262290,
    "trade_proposals": 803,
    "portfolio_snapshots": 1755,
    "connected_accounts": 7,
    "settings": 664,
    "llm_usage": 2491
  },
  "failures": [],
  "archiveDepth": 1,
  "startedAt": "2026-09-09T15:14:28.746Z",
  "completedAt": "2026-09-09T15:24:44.095Z",
  "durationMs": 615349
}
```

Download 127 s, whole drill 615 s.  Every count trails the live database
(`audit_events` 360,059, `trade_proposals` 831, `portfolio_snapshots` 1,877,
`connected_accounts` 7, `settings` 937, `llm_usage` 2,989) exactly as a 2026-08-30 snapshot
should.  The scratch copy was removed.

**So the cold archive tier is stale, not broken:** the object that has been sitting there for
ten days is a genuinely restorable database.  That is a materially different risk position from
the one the health field alone implied.

The drill also earned its keep immediately by finding a bug in the brand-new script: opening the
restored file read-only still leaves `-shm` and `-wal` sidecars behind, which the cleanup missed.
A stray sidecar next to a future scratch file is a corruption hazard, not litter.  Fixed in the
same lane.

## Follow-ups (owner)

1. **Tier 2 host backups.**  `/usr/local/sbin/fleet-sqlite-backup.sh`: `.backup` → `VACUUM INTO`,
   and make a timed-out dump alert instead of `return 0`.  Applies to Congress.Trade and
   Usage-Monitor too — their databases are still small enough to succeed, for now.
2. **Weekly verify output.**  `fleet-backup-verify-weekly.sh` writes `FAIL` into a log file
   nobody reads.  Route it to Slack or Pushover.
3. **Litestream PITR window.**  Production keeps 7 days.  If 30 is wanted, change
   `litestream.coolify.yml` and budget the B2 storage.
4. **Nothing to delete.**  Explicitly: no B2 prune is warranted (41.3 GiB total, not 535 GB), and
   the legacy R2 object is now retained by policy rather than needing a deletion decision.
