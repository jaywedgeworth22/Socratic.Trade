# 2026-07-18 — Session handoff: mobile tab-bar fix (shipped) + open-PR integration (not started)

Handoff note for a cloud session. Covers three threads of work. Read the
"State / next actions" of each before continuing.

---

## 1. Mobile bottom tab-bar wasted-space fix — ✅ MERGED & DEPLOYED

**What:** Owner reported (screenshots) an empty band between the console's fixed
bottom tab bar labels and Safari's address bar on mobile. Root cause: the
`<nav>` in `app/console/components/nav.tsx` applied
`padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` in every display mode, stacking a
second, redundant clearance on top of the one mobile Safari already gives a
`position: fixed; bottom: 0` bar — rendered as an empty band (nav bg == page bg).

**Fix (CSS/markup only):** moved the inline padding to a `.con-tabbar` class in
`app/console/console.css` that reserves the inset only under
`@media (display-mode: standalone), (display-mode: fullscreen)`; browser tabs get
`padding-bottom: 0`. Standalone-PWA behavior unchanged.

**Files:** `app/console/components/nav.tsx`, `app/console/console.css` (+ docs:
`STATUS.md`, `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`, `docs/rollouts/2026-07-18-mobile-tabbar-safe-area-band.md`).

**State:**
- PR **#1726** merged to `main` as squash commit **`2aa53e1`**.
- **DEPLOYED to production** — verified `2aa53e1` is an ancestor of the live
  release SHA (`/api/health` reported `7be7139`, which == `main` tip; prod health
  green: db ok, scheduler ~58s, litestream replicating, 3 active accounts).
- Note: prod briefly sat **6 merged commits behind** (`70a2a39`) during a deploy
  backlog, then caught up on its own — auto-deploy works, it just lagged. No
  manual intervention was needed or done.

**Codex review (P2, addressed on-thread, deliberately not code-changed):** hard
`padding-bottom: 0` in browser mode means the fixed bar won't clear a *non-zero*
bottom safe-area in two configs — **Safari with the address bar at the top**, and
**landscape** — where the bottom label row could sit under the home indicator.
Applying Codex's literal suggestion (keep the inset in browser mode) reintroduces
the exact reported band; CSS can't tell "redundant inset" (bottom-bar layout)
from "needed inset" (top-bar/landscape) apart. Decision: keep the fix (reported
priority = kill the band), accept the P2. Rationale posted on PR #1726 thread
`discussion_r3607222540`.

**Follow-up (optional, only if on-device shows the edge):** add
`@media (orientation: landscape) { .con-tabbar { padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom); } }`
rather than an unconditional inset.

## 2. Open-PR integration ("merge all + deploy") — ⏸️ INVESTIGATED, NOT STARTED

Owner asked to resolve conflicts + comments and merge/deploy all open PRs. I
enumerated and risk-assessed them but **made no merges** — owner ended the turn
before confirming scope. Nothing was changed on any of these branches.

**Open PRs at handoff (all `mergeable_state: "blocked"` = required `verify` not
currently green; none confirmed as git-conflicting against main yet):**

| PR | Author | What | Size | Notes |
|----|--------|------|------|-------|
| #1728 | Antigravity | Sentry noise + sqlite busy_timeout | +172/−19 | |
| #1733 | Claude | OpenRouter Codex follow-ups (P1 Claude reasoning routing) | +158/−11 | fixes live prod bug |
| #1735 | Antigravity | SEC RAG migration **v52** | **+2918/−39, 28 commits** | adds DB migration |
| #1736 | Monet | model-identity canonicalizer dedupe | +168/−47 | touches model-id resolution |
| #1737 | Claude | OpenRouter rotation eligibility + save-gate | +94/−10 | |
| #1738 | Claude | **money-path** P1s (halted broker-stops, Tradier bracket) | +1282/−105 | adds DB table `option_alert_reservations` |

**Conflict map (must be sequenced, not blind-merged):**
- **#1735 ↔ #1738** — both add DB migrations / touch `db.ts` `migrate()`
  (v52 recovery vs. new `option_alert_reservations` table). Classic
  migration-version collision (see `AGENTS.md` "split-vs-modified boundary"
  trap). Renumber one; do NOT let both land unsequenced.
- **#1733 ↔ #1737 ↔ #1736** — all touch `src/lib/llm-provider.ts` /
  model-identity resolution. #1733 explicitly *defers* the rotation-eligibility
  fix that #1737 *implements*, so intended order is **#1733 → #1737**; #1736
  (Monet) will conflict with both. Rebase + sequence.

**Other cautions captured for the next operator:**
- #1735 and #1738 were updated minutes before handoff (07:17–07:18Z) → likely
  **active** in their agents' worktrees; merging out from under a live `land.sh`
  can clobber. Coordinate via `#agent-sync` / effort board first.
- #1738 is **money-path** (live real-money trading) — treat with the money-path
  bar (full gates, adversarial verify).
- "Resolve all comments": several carry open Codex threads. **Address** them,
  don't blind-resolve — some are genuine correctness findings.
- This cloud session has **no Coolify token / SSH key** — cannot unstick a stuck
  deploy or inspect the build queue from here (only public `/api/health`).

**State / next action:** await owner's scope decision (all 6 safely sequenced vs.
Claude PRs only vs. per-PR go/no-go report). No branch was touched.

## 3. Student/free cloud + AI services research — ✅ DELIVERED IN CHAT ONLY

Owner asked for research on free/discounted student cloud-hosting + AI/cloud
offerings (started from an Alibaba Cloud free-tier link). Full multi-source
rundown was delivered **in the conversation** (not committed anywhere). Not a
code change; recorded here only so the thread isn't lost.

**Headlines:** Azure for Students ($100/yr, **no card** — the standout);
GitHub Student Pack (master key: DigitalOcean $200 [excludes GPU/LLM], Heroku
$13/mo×24, etc.); Oracle Always Free (2 OCPU/12 GB Arm always-on, halved from 4
in June 2026); Google Cloud $300/90d (**no longer covers Gemini in AI Studio**);
Alibaba ~$450 + Qwen free tokens (Singapore region). No-card free LLM APIs:
Gemini/AI Studio, Groq, OpenRouter `:free`, Anthropic ~$5. **Removed in
2025–26:** OpenAI free credits, Together AI credits, Fly.io & PlanetScale free
tiers, Cursor student Pro (new undergrads), Copilot student sign-ups (paused).
For a 24/7 trading app: avoid scale-to-zero PaaS free tiers; the practical wins
are LLM-cost offload (Groq/Gemini/Qwen free tiers alongside the existing
OpenRouter routing), not free hosting.

## Loose ends
- A background health-poll (`/api/health` every ~45s, ~18-min cap) may still be
  running from the deploy check; it is read-only and self-expires. Deploy is
  already confirmed, so it can be ignored.

## Verification run this session
- `#1726` gates before merge: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean · `npm run lint` 0 errors
  · `npx vitest run` 405 files / 4758 tests pass · `npm run build` clean.
- Prod deploy verified via `curl https://socratictrade.com/api/health` +
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor 2aa53e1 <prod-sha>`.

## Addendum (2026-07-19, PR #1774 Codex-review triage)

Codex left 3 review findings on this note in PR #1774. Re-verified each in a
fresh worktree rather than trusting the review framing as still current
(more time had passed):

1. **Commit author identity (P1).** Codex's comment referenced `git show
   --format=fuller bbe7fe3` showing `Codex <codex@openai.com>` as both author
   and committer. That short hash is not reachable anywhere in this branch's
   history at the time of this addendum: both commits unique to the branch
   (`aaca9be3`, this rollout note; `540190fd`, the merge-from-main commit)
   already carry the correct `12656028+jaywedgeworth22@users.noreply.github.com`
   identity for both author and committer, confirmed via `git log
   --format=fuller 7be7139..claude/mobile-view-spacing-oetyav`. The commit was
   evidently already re-authored (hash changed `bbe7fe3` -> `aaca9be3`)
   between whatever Codex inspected and its comment landing. **No rebase was
   needed or performed.**
2. **Stale STATUS.md / EFFORT-LOG.md mobile tab-bar status (P2).** Confirmed
   real: `STATUS.md` still read "PR pending" / "Next: push branch + open PR"
   for this work. Re-verified current reality: PR **#1726** merged
   2026-07-18T06:30:22Z as squash `2aa53e1`, which is an ancestor of both
   `origin/main` and the currently deployed production release SHA. Fixed in
   the same PR (#1774): `STATUS.md`'s entry now says Merged/Deployed;
   `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`'s row for this work (added at `2aa53e1`, then dropped
   — not flipped to Completed — by a later `docs(effort-log): sync repo
   mirror` pass) is restored with the correct Completed/Deployed state.
3. **Stale open-PR inventory (P2).** Re-verified via `gh pr view <n> --json
   state,mergedAt` for all 6 PRs in the section-2 table below: all merged
   2026-07-18, all ancestors of `main`.

   | PR | Merged at (UTC) | Merge commit |
   |----|------------------|--------------|
   | #1728 | 2026-07-18T13:23:06Z | `a02e417e` |
   | #1733 | 2026-07-18T14:21:23Z | `df63bc76` |
   | #1735 | 2026-07-18T15:22:51Z | `9a95b22c` |
   | #1736 | 2026-07-18T14:38:29Z | `14a25371` |
   | #1737 | 2026-07-18T14:14:12Z | `6f675f95` |
   | #1738 | 2026-07-18T14:19:24Z | `4e3694a5` |

   The "must be sequenced, not blind-merged" conflict-map guidance in section
   2 is now historical only — they landed without an unresolved collision;
   no follow-up action needed there.

Section 2's original text above is left intact as the historical record of
what was known at handoff time — do not treat it as a current PR inventory.
