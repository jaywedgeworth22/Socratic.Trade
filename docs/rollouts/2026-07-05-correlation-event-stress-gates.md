# 2026-07-05 - correlation-event-stress-gates

## Summary

Lane 3 of the 5-lane parallel risk-engine build: three new advisory RECEIPTS attached to opening
(buy/short) proposals — never new blocking gates.

1. **EWMA + downside correlation** (`src/lib/correlation.ts`): added `ewmaCorrelation` (RiskMetrics-
   style exponentially weighted correlation, more responsive to a recent regime shift than the
   existing equal-weight `pearson`), `downsideCorrelation` (Pearson conditioned on the HOLDING's down
   days only — "when what I already own falls, does the candidate fall too"), and `correlationProfile`
   (per-holding pearson/EWMA/downside + `maxPairwise`/`avgEwma` summary, capped at 15 holdings by
   |marketValue| descending). None of the existing exports (`alignedReturns`, `pearson`,
   `avgReturnCorrelation`) changed behavior; `applyCorrelationClusterGate` (the existing opt-in
   `policy.maxAvgCorrelation` gate) is untouched.
2. **Per-candidate correlation + pre-trade stress receipts** (`src/lib/strategy.ts`, new
   `applyRiskReceipts` function): for each opening proposal, appends a `\n\n[Risk] Correlation: …`
   rationale note + `audit("correlation_receipt", …)`, and a `\n\n[Risk] Stress …` rationale note +
   `audit("stress_receipt", …)` from a new deterministic parametric stress engine
   (`src/lib/stress-scenario.ts`, pure, no I/O). Both gated behind one new flag,
   `policy.tuning.riskReceipts` (default false/undefined) — off means zero extra `fetchDailyOHLC`
   calls and byte-identical rationale/prompt/audit trail.
3. **Earnings-proximity advisory blackout** (openings only, also in `applyRiskReceipts`): an
   unconditional `\n\n[Risk] Earnings in N trading day(s)` note whenever `quote.daysToEarnings <= 7`
   (skipped silently when unknown — never fabricated), and — only when the separate
   `policy.tuning.earningsBlackout` flag is on AND `daysToEarnings <= earningsBlackoutDays` (default
   3) — an overridable `earnings_blackout: …` tag pushed onto `proposal.preVetoReasons`, following the
   exact PR #814 pattern (folds into the sized `PolicyDecision` right before `resolveSocraticOverride`,
   classified as an overridable preference by `isHardGateReason`, never a hard block).

No macro-event (FOMC/CPI) calendar was built — confirmed out of scope per the lane spec (none exists
in this codebase; see Follow-ups).

## Why

The board row asked for EWMA/downside correlation, earnings/macro-event blackout windows, and
pre-trade scenario stress on proposals, ALL as advisory receipts — the house convention throughout
this codebase (deterministic-bear/red-team pre-vetoes, correlation cluster gate, ATR stops, etc.) is
"receipts, not cages": inform the agent/owner, log it, and let an `autonomyOverride` thesis pass any
non-hard gate. This lane extends that pattern rather than inventing a new blocking mechanism, and
reuses the existing `preVetoReasons` fold-in from PR #814 so the earnings tag is overridable for free
(no new override plumbing).

## Files

- `src/lib/correlation.ts` — added `ewmaCorrelation`, `downsideCorrelation`, `correlationProfile`,
  `HoldingCorrelation`, `CorrelationProfile`, `MAX_CORRELATION_PROFILE_HOLDINGS` (=15). Existing
  exports unchanged.
- `src/lib/stress-scenario.ts` (new) — `stressScenario`, `StressScenarioInputs`,
  `StressPositionInput`, `StressCandidateInput`, `StressResult`, `StressContributor`. Pure, no I/O.
- `src/lib/strategy.ts` — new `applyRiskReceipts` function (correlation + stress + earnings receipts);
  wired into the proposal pipeline right after `applyCorrelationClusterGate` resolves (before the
  rationale-diversity check), renaming the intermediate variable to `gatedProposals` so `proposals`
  still names the final set consumed downstream. New imports: `correlationProfile` from
  `./correlation`, `stressScenario`/`StressPositionInput` from `./stress-scenario`.
- `src/lib/types.ts` — three new `TuningSettings` fields: `riskReceipts?: boolean` (covers Parts 2+4
  — correlation + stress receipts, one flag per COMMON.md guidance since they're the two halves of
  one feature and share the same cost-bounding rationale), `earningsBlackout?: boolean`,
  `earningsBlackoutDays?: number` (default 3 when the flag is on). All default false/undefined with
  "byte-identical" doc comments matching the house `calibrationSizing`/`skipNegativeExpectancy`
  pattern.
- `test/correlation-ewma.test.ts` (new) — `ewmaCorrelation` hand-computed vs plain Pearson (shows the
  EWMA is measurably more responsive to a recent correlation-regime shift), min-sample/zero-variance/
  lambda-range guards; `downsideCorrelation` conditioning on down days, min-sample guard, custom
  floor, zero-variance guard, perfect-correlation clamp. 11 tests.
- `test/stress-scenario.test.ts` (new) — known book (long+short+beta mix) matching hand-computed
  impacts, sign correctness for short positions and short candidates (both gain under a down shock),
  sell/cover candidates contributing zero marginal impact, missing-beta fallback + `betasEstimated`
  threshold (>half), equity<=0 → undefined, top-3 contributor ranking, vix/shockSigmas defaults.
  11 tests.
- `test/risk-receipts.test.ts` (new, integration) — flag OFF is byte-identical (no `[Risk]` notes, no
  `preVetoReasons`, `fetchDailyOHLC` never called); flag ON attaches correlation+stress notes with
  mocked bars and audits both receipts; correlation note is skipped (never fabricated) when there are
  no holdings or bar data is insufficient; exits (sell/cover) are never touched; earnings note is
  unconditional at `daysToEarnings<=7` regardless of flags, only the `preVetoReasons` tag depends on
  `earningsBlackout` + being inside the window; unknown `daysToEarnings` is skipped silently. 9 tests.
- `test/hard-gate-classification.test.ts` — pinned one new case: `earnings_blackout: opening within 2
  day(s) of earnings (window 3)` classifies as a PREFERENCE (`isHardGateReason(...) === false`), same
  as the existing `deterministic_bear_veto:`/`red_team_veto:` pre-veto prefixes.

## Verification

Run from the worktree root (`/Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade/.claude/worktrees/monet-corr-stress`):

- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean, no output.
- Focused: `npx vitest run test/correlation-ewma.test.ts test/stress-scenario.test.ts test/risk-receipts.test.ts test/hard-gate-classification.test.ts test/policy.test.ts test/red-team.test.ts test/market-regime.test.ts test/regime-gate-adoption.test.ts test/deterministic-bear.test.ts test/correlation-cluster-gate.test.ts`
  → **10 files passed, 176 tests passed**.
- Full suite: `npm test -- --run` → first attempt under heavy CPU contention (5+ sibling worktrees
  running full suites concurrently) reported 9 files / 11 tests FAILED, all `Error: Test timed out in
  20000ms/30000ms` on unrelated LLM-mocked tests (`strategy-llm-failover`, `strategy-prompt-safety`,
  `strategy-rationale-collapse-gate`, `strategy-tuning`, `security-admin-timing-safe`) plus one
  flaky-under-load assertion in `strategy-tuning.test.ts`; none of these files were touched by this
  lane. Re-ran those 5 failing files in isolation with a longer timeout → **31/31 passed**. Re-ran the
  FULL suite once contention eased → **263 files passed, 2609 tests passed**, 62.17s wall — clean.
- `npm run lint` → **0 errors, 309 warnings** (matches the documented pre-existing baseline; grepped
  the lint output for every new/touched file — zero warnings from `correlation.ts`,
  `stress-scenario.ts`, `strategy.ts`, or any of the four test files).
- Did NOT run `npm run build` per lane instructions (orchestrator runs it at landing).

## Follow-ups

- **Macro-event calendar (FOMC/CPI) is explicitly out of scope** — no such data source exists
  anywhere in this codebase (confirmed by the reference map's exhaustive grep); only a per-symbol
  Yahoo earnings-date field (`daysToEarnings`) exists. If macro-event blackouts are wanted later,
  they need a new calendar data source (e.g. FRED's release-calendar endpoint) wired through
  `src/lib/macro.ts`, which today only fetches point-in-time levels, not future release dates.
- `correlationProfile` caps holdings considered at 15 (by `|marketValue|` descending) to bound
  bar-fetch cost; a book with >15 positions will silently truncate (flagged via `truncated: true` in
  the returned profile, though the current rationale-note text doesn't surface the truncation count —
  worth adding `"(top 15 of N)"` to the note if operators run larger books routinely).
- `stressScenario` uses a single market factor (beta) — it does not model idiosyncratic/sector
  co-movement or a full covariance matrix. This was explicit lane scope ("Out of scope:
  covariance-matrix portfolio VaR"); a future iteration could blend in `correlationProfile`'s pairwise
  correlations for a two-factor (market + cluster) shock.
- No run-level VIX is currently plumbed from `marketScan` into `applyRiskReceipts`; the stress receipt
  always falls back to `stressScenario`'s own default (20, long-run-average VIX) rather than the
  live VIX level `src/lib/macro.ts`/`market-signals/cboe.ts` may already have fetched this run. Wiring
  the live VIX through would make the stress shock size reflect actual current volatility instead of
  a flat assumption — left out here to keep this lane's diff to `strategy.ts` minimal (the live VIX
  isn't threaded into the proposal pipeline's local scope at the `applyRiskReceipts` call site today).
- The correlation + stress receipts run sequentially per opening proposal (same O(holdings) fetch
  pattern as the existing `avgReturnCorrelation`); a run with many opening proposals AND `riskReceipts`
  enabled will multiply `fetchDailyOHLC` calls — bounded by the existing 30-min history cache and the
  15-holding cap, but worth watching rate limits on `reserveMassiveRestCall` if usage grows.

## Deviations from spec

- The spec's Part 2 named the correlation note format as `[Risk] Correlation: max ${corr} w/ ...`; I
  render `corr`/`avgEwma` as percentages (`(max.corr * 100).toFixed(0)}%`) rather than raw
  `-1..1` decimals for readability, consistent with how other rationale notes in this codebase format
  percentages (e.g. sizing notes use `%`). This is a formatting choice, not a semantic deviation.
- The spec suggested naming the combined Part 2+4 flag `riskReceipts` "one flag, one doc comment" —
  implemented exactly as specified.
- `isHardGateReason` was NOT modified — the spec asked to "confirm" `earnings_blackout: ...`
  classifies as overridable, which it already does via the existing denylist-default fallthrough (no
  special prefix carve-out was needed, unlike `deterministic_bear_veto:`/`red_team_veto:`, since the
  earnings-blackout free text never contains a hard-gate substring). Added the pinning test case only.
