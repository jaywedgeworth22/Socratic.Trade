# 2026-07-03 — Rebrand: Agentic Trading → Socratic Trade / socratictrade.com

## Summary
The owner stood up production infrastructure under the name **Socratic Trade** at **socratictrade.com**
and asked to align the codebase to it. External infra was already done owner-side: the Sentry project
was named "socratic trade" from the start, `socratictrade.com` is pointed via Cloudflare, the GitHub
OAuth config + Google authorized domains were updated. `socratic.trade` also resolves but does not need
wiring — it doubles as the no-space form of the name.

Branch `claude/rebrand-socratic-trade`, off `origin/main` after #339 merged (so it carries the
VITEST-gated `isTradingDay` seam and is CI-green).

## What changed
**Display brand — "Agentic Trading" → "Socratic Trade":**
- `app/manifest.ts` — `name` "Socratic Trade"; `short_name` "Socratic.Trade" (the no-space form the
  owner endorsed for compact contexts); `description`.
- `app/layout.tsx` — `applicationName`, `appleWebApp.title`, meta `description`.
- `app/mobile/page.tsx` — `description`; `app/mobile/mobile-pwa-client.tsx` — the header `<h1>`.

**Public host fallback — old production host → `https://socratictrade.com`** (env-first:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` / `x-forwarded-host` still take precedence; this is only the hardcoded default):
- `src/lib/public-origin.ts`, `app/robots.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/layout.tsx` (`metadataBase`),
  `README.md` (production URL + Robinhood-callback example), and the `test/mcp-oauth.test.ts` /
  `test/logout-route.test.ts` fixtures (they use a concrete public host as a stand-in; updated for
  internal consistency — the tests assert env-driven behavior, not the fallback).

**Runtime source identifiers — old app slug → `socratic-trade` / `SocraticTrade`**:
- `next.config.mjs` Sentry project fallback, `src/lib/usage-monitor-push.ts` telemetry source,
  webhook notification `source` / `user-agent`, Robinhood MCP initialize `clientInfo.name`, FINRA
  fetch user-agent, and the account-deletion audit fallback salt now use the Socratic Trade identity.
  Env overrides still take precedence where present.

## Deliberately NOT changed (and why)
- **`mail@jays.services`** — the owner's LOGIN email (`middleware.ts`, `src/lib/auth/identity.ts`,
  `app/welcome/page.tsx`, `app/how-it-works/page.tsx` mailto). `jays.services` is both a hostname and
  the owner's email domain; changing the email would lock the owner out of auth. Left every
  `mail@jays.services` occurrence intact — the rebrand only touched `socratictrade.com` HOSTNAMES.
- **The Robinhood account nickname "Agentic"** (`dashboard-client.tsx`, `connected-accounts/route.ts`,
  `robinhood.ts`) — the label the owner puts on the Robinhood account so the app detects it; an
  account-detection convention, not the product name.
- **Internal `jays.services` preview/beta subdomains** (`trading-beta`, `codex`/`claude`/`antigravity`
  previews) — the owner's local multi-agent dev infra, unchanged.
- The generic **"Socratic Trade"** title / OG `siteName` — a secondary identity the app already kept
  distinct from the "Agentic Trading" brand; preserved that split rather than overreach into an SEO
  title decision the owner didn't ask for.

## Why
Owner's most recent explicit request: align the app to the Socratic Trade identity now that the domain,
Sentry project, and OAuth are set up externally. The scope now includes active source identifiers in
addition to public brand and host fallback. `mail@jays.services` remains the login email, not a
product hostname.

## Files
`app/manifest.ts`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/mobile/page.tsx`, `app/mobile/mobile-pwa-client.tsx`,
`src/lib/public-origin.ts`, `app/robots.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `next.config.mjs`, `README.md`,
`src/lib/usage-monitor-push.ts`, `src/lib/notify.ts`, `src/lib/mcp-oauth.ts`,
`src/lib/web-sources/finra.ts`, `src/lib/account-deletion.ts`, `test/mcp-oauth.test.ts`,
`test/logout-route.test.ts`, `test/usage-monitor-push.test.ts`. Docs: `STATUS.md`,
`docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`, this rollout note.

## Verification
`npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (full suite), `npm run build`, `npm run lint` — run before push (results
recorded in the commit / PR). No `mail@jays.services` occurrence altered (confirmed by grep). No old
production hostname remains in active `app/`/`src/`/`test/` paths (confirmed by grep).

## Follow-ups
- If the owner later wants the internal jays.services preview subdomains renamed, handle that as a
  separate infra/worktree coordination change.
- If production is fully cut over to socratictrade.com (not just Cloudflare-fronted), confirm
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is set to `https://socratictrade.com` in the prod env so the fallback is never
  relied on.
