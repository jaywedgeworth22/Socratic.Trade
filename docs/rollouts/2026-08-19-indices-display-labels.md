# 2026-08-19 — Show “S&P 500”, not “sp500”, on Indices rows

## Context & Objective

User-facing Indices lists printed storage slugs (`sp500`) instead of product names (`S&P 500`).  Internal `IndexUniverse` ids, `defaults.ts` `includedIndices: ["sp500"]`, and snapshot / API payloads stay slugs.  Copy/UI only.

## Changes Made

Web Guardrails checkboxes already used the product names.  The leak was iOS Guardrails (`DeskCopy.joinedList` on raw `includedIndices`) and the web policy-diff extra-patch summary (`adds russell2000`).  Scan source chips already map `sp500-universe` → `S&P 500 Universe`.  Display now goes through `indexUniverseLabel` / `indexUniverseDisplayLabel`; web `INDICES` is derived from `INDEX_UNIVERSES` so the labels cannot drift.

## Decisions & Trade-offs

- Reused `INDEX_UNIVERSES[].label` (`S&P 500`, `Nasdaq 100`, …).  Did not invent a second map.
- Unknown slugs are omitted from the label list so a future id cannot print as camelCase copy.  Direction still uses the raw set-diff.
- iOS duplicates the same eight labels in `DeskCopy` because Swift cannot import the TS helper.  Tests lock both sides to the same strings.
- Did not change API ids, storage, or `defaults.ts`.  Did not touch #2841 / #2849 / #2854 / #2840 / #2850.  Did not merge, deploy, bounce, TF, or click Run once.

## Verification State

```bash
npx vitest run test/index-universes.test.ts test/console-policy-diff.test.ts
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Next Steps & Blockers

Jay merges.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce / TF from this seat.

## Zero-Code Findings

Hypothesis held for iOS: Guardrails was joining raw slugs.  Web Guardrails chips were already labeled.  The stray web leak was policy-diff, not a Scan chip.  Scan source chips already use `S&P 500 Universe` / `NASDAQ Composite Universe`.
