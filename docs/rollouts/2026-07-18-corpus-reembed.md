## URGENT — run-me-now sequencing (read this first)

**Production deployed current `main` this morning with the bge-m3 embed flip LIVE, and prod
health shows voyage `ok:false`. That means retrieval is ALREADY running against the bge-m3
embedding space, which is EMPTY until this re-embed runs.** Embedding-space isolation
(`embedSpaceFilterForModel`, PR #1669) is doing exactly what it was designed to do — refusing to
rank bge queries against Voyage vectors — so every dense-retrieval consumer (filings evidence,
episodic experience memory, insider/disclosure context) is degraded to sparse/no-match until the
corpus is backfilled into the new space.

**The recovery sequence — FULL-CORPUS RUNS ONLY (no `symbols` param):**

```bash
# 1. Optional but recommended: see scope without spending anything
curl -X POST https://socratictrade.com/api/admin/reembed \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_REINDEX_TOKEN" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dryRun": true}'

# 2. Kick the real run (fire-and-forget; returns immediately). NO symbols param — only a
#    full-corpus run advances watermarks and (eventually) the completion receipts.
curl -X POST https://socratictrade.com/api/admin/reembed \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_REINDEX_TOKEN" -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{}'

# 3. Poll progress until every docType shows status "completed" with failed: 0
curl https://socratictrade.com/api/admin/reembed -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_REINDEX_TOKEN"
```

Scale expectation: ~8.5k existing vectors in the corpus, so a server-side run is
**minutes-to-hours** under the default daily fuses (`RAG_INGEST_MAX_TEXTS_PER_DAY` 20k,
`RAG_PINECONE_MAX_WRITE_UNITS_PER_DAY` 200k — one calendar day of headroom covers the whole
corpus; the pacing knob that actually dominates wall-clock is `VECTOR_EMBED_BATCH_DELAY_MS`). If a
run stops with `stopped-budget`, re-POST after the 24h window rolls — the watermark resumes where
it left off and already-committed content is skipped for free. Symbol-scoped runs are supported
only as stateless targeted top-ups AFTER the full run completes — they persist no watermarks and
can never satisfy the purge gate.

**Purge stays OFF until a full clean run has completed for every covered docType.** The purge
action (below) is never automatic, requires its confirm token, and refuses unless the CURRENT
space shows a completed, zero-failure, full-corpus scan per docType. Even then there is no
urgency: the old space is invisible to bge-m3 queries either way; it costs only storage.

## Summary

New module `src/lib/rag/corpus-reembed.ts` + admin route `app/api/admin/reembed/route.ts`:
re-ingests all locally-held re-embeddable content through the EXISTING `storeDocument`/
`storeContexts` pipeline so it lands in whatever embedding space is currently active
(`activeEmbeddingModel`). Idempotent, resumable (durable per-docType watermarks), serialized
under the shared `RAG_REINDEX` operation lease, and budget-fused exactly like normal ingestion.

Covered docTypes (all rebuilt from the local SQLite DB — zero provider re-fetch):

| docType | Local source | Pipeline | Identity (documentKey) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sec-filings` | `document_chunks_fts` (10-K/10-Q chunk text, `source='sec-edgar'`) joined to `sec_filings` for form/dates | `storeDocument` | `<accession>:<content_hash>` |
| `earningscalls-transcripts` | `earningscalls_transcripts.content` | `storeDocument` | `earningscalls:<SYM>:<FY>Q<Q>` (shared `accessionFor`, now exported) |
| `experience-memory` | `fill_events` replayed through `calculatePnl` per connected account (new additive helper `listClosedLotExperienceDocumentsForAccount`) | `storeContexts` (private scope) | account-level watermark; Pinecone id is the stable `exp:<entryProposalId>:<exitProposalId>` accession |
| `insider-form4` | `sec_insider_transactions` aggregated per (cik, accession, insider), P/S codes only, CIK→ticker via `loadCikMap` | `storeDocument` | `insider-form4:<accession>:<cik>:<insider>` |

Explicitly out of scope (refresh on their own cadence; documented in the module header): 8-K
summaries, FMP transcripts (rights-gated), congress trades, fundamentals cards.

## Why / key decisions

- **Never bypasses vector-db primitives.** Every embed goes through `storeDocument` (or
  `storeContexts` for experience-memory, whose retrieval-critical metadata — return_pct,
  risk_exit, factor scores, proposal/run ids — has no home in `storeDocument`'s filing-shaped
  `ChunkInput`). Ledger receipts, `chunk_occurrences`, both daily budget fuses, and embed batch
  pacing all apply automatically.
- **Cross-space skip-if-exists is inherited, not reimplemented.** `storeDocument`'s commit id
  (`vcommit:v3:` hash, vector-db.ts:3298-3310) and every occurrence vector id incorporate the
  model-aware embedding-space revision (`embeddingSpaceRevisionForModel`, vector-db.ts:146-149 —
  bare `v1` for Voyage, `v1-baai-bge-m3` for bge). `committedVectorCommitDisposition`
  (vector-db.ts:3031-3110), checked at the top of the serialized commit block
  (vector-db.ts:3368-3399) BEFORE any provider call, returns an exact `reusedCommitted` receipt
  when the same content was already committed in the SAME space — so a rerun is free — and
  naturally misses when the space differs — so a model flip re-embeds. No new guard needed for the
  `storeDocument` paths.
- **The one guard that WAS needed:** `storeContexts` (experience-memory) has no model-aware
  commit id — its Pinecone id comes from `contextId` (source/symbol/accession/timestamp,
  vector-db.ts:1853-1860) and its `dedupKeyPrefix` content-hash dedup is model-agnostic. Fix:
  the re-embed uses a dedup prefix namespaced by the active embed revision
  (`experience-memory:reembed:v1-baai-bge-m3`), so same-space reruns dedup for free and a model
  flip re-embeds. Because the Pinecone id is stable across models, the re-embed OVERWRITES the
  old vector in place — no legacy residue, which is why `experience-memory` is excluded from the
  purge scan.
- **Watermarks** live in the internal settings table (`corpusReembed:progress`), advanced only
  after each item is processed and persisted per-item, so a crash/restart resumes precisely.
  Budget exhaustion (`budgetSkipped`/`writeUnitBudgetSkipped`/`unconfigured` from the store
  result) stops the WHOLE run (the fuses are shared across sources) without advancing past the
  deferred item. Dry runs persist NOTHING.
- **Lease serialization:** real runs go through a new `startDetachedOperationLease` primitive in
  `operation-lease.ts` (fire-and-forget acquisition + heartbeat + owner-token release; the
  existing `runWithOperationLease` can't return before its callback finishes). Same
  `RAG_REINDEX` group as `refreshFilingBodies`/`reconcileManagedVectorRecords`, so a re-embed
  can never race scheduled SEC ingest, and a second POST while running gets HTTP-busy.
- **Legacy purge is separate, explicit, and double-gated:** requires
  `{action:'purge-legacy', confirm:'purge-voyage-vectors'}`, refuses while Voyage is still the
  active model, and refuses unless the progress state shows `completed` under the CURRENT embed
  revision (with zero failures) for every covered docType. Deletion uses the new
  `purgeManagedVectorsByIds` primitive in vector-db.ts (exact-id `deleteMany` batches, same
  pattern as account erasure's `purgeExactIds`; never a metadata-filter delete), targeting only
  vector ids proven by local receipts (`vector_ingest_commits.embed_revision != current`).
- **Admin route posture:** `requireAdmin(request, { requireTokenInProd: true })` — same as
  `/api/admin/reindex-10k`, because a real run spends provider budget.

(Full `npm test`/`npm run build` deferred to the `verify` CI gate on the PR, per task scope.)

Test scenarios covered: FTS-sourced filing text lands in the bge-m3 space with correct
`embed_model`/`embed_revision` stamps; full-rescan rerun reuses committed receipts with zero
provider calls (idempotency); budget exhaustion mid-run stops cleanly with a resumable watermark
and the deferred item embeds on resume; dry run returns counts with zero embeds/upserts and zero
persisted state; dry run classifies already-committed current-space content as reused; purge
refuses on incomplete coverage, on a wrong confirm token, and while Voyage is still active.

## Adversarial hardening (2026-07-18, follow-up commit)

Adversarial verification of `1d206d4a` (already live on main via PR #1764) found three MUST-FIX
defects, all fixed in the hardening commit. Exploit + fix are proven by
`test/corpus-reembed-adversarial.test.ts` (originally written to EXHIBIT the bug; assertions now
inverted to prove the fix).

**MUST-FIX 1 — the purge gate was satisfiable by partial runs.** Exploit: a symbol-scoped bge run
stamped `completedForEmbedRevision`, unlocking a purge that deleted the ONLY copy of every symbol
the scoped run never touched. Fixes:
- Symbol-scoped runs are now fully **stateless**: no watermarks, no cumulative counts, no
  completion stamps (they'd also have corrupted full-run coverage — a scoped scan's watermark
  skips unrequested symbols forever). Idempotency for scoped reruns rides on committed-receipt
  reuse instead.
- Watermarks are **namespaced by embedding-space revision** (`watermarkEmbedRevision`): a stale
  watermark from another space is discarded and the corpus rescans. Without this, the NEXT model
  flip would resume an end-of-corpus watermark, instantly "complete" with zero embeds, and let
  the purge delete the whole previous corpus (since "legacy" = every non-current space).
- Counts (incl. `failed`) are **cumulative across the resume chain**, so a failure in run 1 still
  blocks the purge after run 2 resumes past it. Recovery flow: `{action:"reset-watermarks"}` →
  fresh full scan (committed content reuses free; failures retry) → gate re-evaluates.
- The run **aborts on mid-run active-model drift** (checked at every item boundary; status
  `error`), so a mid-run key change can't silently split one run across two spaces.
- The purge **retires the purged commits' ledger receipts** in the same operation (commits →
  `aborted`, `chunk_occurrences` + `vector_document_heads` rows removed, only after the provider
  delete succeeded per docType). Otherwise drift reports would flag receipt-without-vector ghosts
  forever, and a voyage flip-back would `reusedCommitted` against deleted vectors.
- Docs/messages now state the true scope: the purge removes **ALL non-current embedding spaces**
  for the covered docTypes, not just voyage-finance-2's (the confirm token keeps its historical
  name for runbook continuity).

**MUST-FIX 2 — identity mismatch with live ingest paths (post-flip double-embedding).**
- `earningscalls-transcripts`: now byte-identical to the live `ingestCachedTranscript` document
  INCLUDING the url (which feeds `retrievalMetadataVersion` → the commit id), so backfill and
  live path dedup onto the same commit in both directions.
- `sec-filings`: the live whole-document identity (doc_id `ticker:accession:docType`, sections,
  url) cannot be reconstructed from FTS chunk rows, so instead the backfill **skips any accession
  the live path already committed into the current space** (probing `vector_ingest_commits` for
  the live doc_id shape, counted as `reusedInSpace`). The earlier in-code comment claiming
  same-commit dedup with the live path was wrong and is corrected.
- `insider-form4`: see MUST-FIX 3 — removed from default docTypes; when explicitly run, its
  identity remains backfill-specific (the live disclosure path is a differently-shaped
  `storeContexts` write, flag-gated off by default), documented as an accepted limitation.

**MUST-FIX 3 — insider Form-4 PIT lookahead.** Chosen option: **both** halves of the suggested
fix. (a) `insider-form4` is dropped from `DEFAULT_CORPUS_REEMBED_DOC_TYPES` (explicit opt-in
only) until a real filed-at source exists; (b) when explicitly run, availability is stamped at
`period_of_report + 2 business days` (`insiderForm4AvailabilityFloor`, weekend-aware) — the far
end of the SEC §16 filing window, so backtests see the vector no earlier than the public could
have seen the filing. Residual accepted risk: a deadline crossing a market HOLIDAY could make the
true filing later than the stamp (holidays not modeled); one more reason it's off by default.

Also added: `POST {action:"reset-watermarks", docTypes?}` on the admin route (operator recovery),
lease-serialized like every other action.

## Follow-ups / risks

- **Insider Form-4 `filedAt` approximation:** `sec_insider_transactions` has no accepted-at
  column, so re-embedded insider docs use `MAX(period_of_report)` as the filed/point-in-time
  stamp. Slightly earlier than the true EDGAR acceptance time → conservatively PIT-safe for
  as-of retrieval (never claims later availability than reality), but the text differs in that
  one field from live-path documents.
- **`symbols` filter scope:** applies to sec-filings / earningscalls / insider-form4 only;
  experience-memory always runs account-granular (documented in-module).
- **Experience-memory dry-run counts** report "would embed" without a per-doc reuse estimate
  (the `storeContexts` dedup check is per-batch); counts for that docType are an upper bound.
- **Ops metric to watch during the prod run:** `GET /api/admin/reembed` per-docType `failed`
  counts, plus the standard usage-limit alerts (the run deliberately trips them if it hits a
  fuse). Sentry breadcrumbs come free via the existing store pipeline.
- The bare FTS join means any historical FTS rows whose accession is missing from `sec_filings`
  still re-embed (form defaults to 10-K, dates fall back) — acceptable; the text + accession are
  what retrieval needs.

## 2026-07-19 review follow-up (CLAUDE): two P1s fixed, one P2 deliberately deferred

Three unresolved `chatgpt-codex-connector` threads on PR #1777 were triaged.

**Fixed — P1 "Reject pre-fix completion stamps".** The purge gate trusted any persisted
`completedForEmbedRevision`, including a row written *before* this hardening, when a symbol-scoped
run could still stamp completion. Such a row carries `status: "completed"`, a matching revision, and
`failed: 0` — satisfying every prior gate condition — while covering only the symbols that one
scoped run visited. This is not hypothetical: production already runs bge-m3, so a poisoned stamp
may already exist in the settings table. The gate now additionally requires
`watermarkEmbedRevision === embedRevision`; that field did not exist pre-hardening, so its absence
forces one fresh full scan before any purge is authorized. Regression test:
*"purge refuses a PRE-HARDENING completion stamp (no watermarkEmbedRevision), even though it looks
complete"* in `test/corpus-reembed-adversarial.test.ts`, which seeds a legacy-shaped progress row
directly and asserts refusal with zero provider deletes.

**Fixed — P1 "Re-check active revision after vector writes".** The per-item drift guard runs
*before* each write, so a model flip landing during the **final** item's async write had no later
boundary to trip: the loop ended normally with `completed: true` and stamped completion naming a
space the run was no longer writing into. Completion is now stamped only if the active model still
matches at persist time (`stampCompletion`). Counts and the watermark still persist — they carry
`watermarkEmbedRevision`, so a later run under a different space discards rather than resumes them —
and only the delete-authorizing flag is withheld.

**Deferred with cause — P2 "Refuse to retire receipts from another provider authority".** The
finding is valid: `legacyReceiptsFor` selects by `source` + `embed_revision` only, so after a
Pinecone key/index authority change the purge would delete ids through the *current* provider and
retire local receipts for vectors still living in the *old* one. It is **not** fixed here because
the obvious fix does not work from this module: the write path stamps
`providerAuthorityForInitKey` (which falls back to a synthetic `fallback|<initKey>` hash when the
index host is unresolved) while `getCurrentVectorProviderAuthority` uses
`stableProviderAuthorityForInitKey`, which has no fallback — so the two disagree whenever the
authority map was populated differently between write and purge. Adding the filter made the
adversarial purge delete **0 of 2** legitimately-purgeable vectors, i.e. it would silently disable
the purge rather than harden it. The real fix is to reconcile that fallback-vs-stable asymmetry
inside `vector-db.ts` (and likely backfill `provider_authority` on existing commits) — a separate
change with its own blast radius. Recorded in-module at `legacyReceiptsFor`.

**Follow-up (open):** reconcile `providerAuthorityForInitKey` vs `stableProviderAuthorityForInitKey`
in `vector-db.ts`, then re-apply the authority filter to `legacyReceiptsFor` with coverage for the
changed-authority case.
