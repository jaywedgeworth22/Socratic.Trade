# 2026-08-02 — Data-cascade freshness: pause #2 handoff (Stage 1 DONE, Stage 2 partial)

**Seat:** MONET · **Branch:** `monet/data-cascade-freshness` · **Worktree:** `/Users/jay/apps/socratic-monet-data-cascade`
**Supersedes-in-part:** `docs/rollouts/2026-08-01-data-cascade-freshness-handoff.md` (pause #1 — still canonical for the recon synthesis, design rationale, and artifact paths).

Owner paused work mid-Stage-2. This note is the exact resume point.

## 1. Context & Objective

Same objective as pause-#1 note. Since then: work RESUMED on owner instruction, AG's takeover was reconciled (AG covered a slice of plan item 8 via PR #2337/#2342; I reviewed and merged AG's open **PR #2343** — all-refs nightly push, CI green), branch re-based onto post-AG main (`437e0104`), and the 3-stage implementation workflow ran until stopped.

## 2. Changes Made (all on the branch, pushed)

**Commit `7d552c8e` — Stage 1 COMPLETE + VERIFIED** (tsc + targeted vitest green before commit):
- `src/lib/market-hours.ts`: new `expiresAtRespectingMarketClose(now, baseTtlMs)` (weekend/holiday-aware cache expiry; +44-test coverage in test/market-hours.test.ts).
- Applied at close-stable cache writes: `market.ts` (screener), `data-providers.ts` (enrichment TTL + Massive short-interest; ROIC TTL 30min→6h), `history.ts` (OHLC), `macro.ts` (macro 24h sites — VIX 10-min left live), `macro-history.ts`. Alpaca snapshot untouched.
- `scan-singleflight.ts`: interactive seed gate is calendar-aware (Friday seed valid Monday morning; future-skew rejection kept).
- `provider-rate-limit.ts`: enforced defaults for filingapi (45/day), roic (200/day + pacing), marketstack (3/day ≈ 100/mo); env `PROVIDER_QUOTA_*` still authoritative; tests added.
- `docs/market-data-provider-pricing.md`: +116 lines — FilingAPI/ROIC/RapidAPI lanes added, Known-gaps updated, delisted hubs flagged.
- `docs/market-data-free-tier-research-2026-08-02.md`: NEW — full free-tier research + owner gap report (see §6).

**Commit (this pause) — Stage 2 PARTIAL, labeled WIP: compiles (tsc clean), tests NOT run, lanes were killed mid-work:**
- Lane B (scheduled 24h scan): NEW `src/lib/market-scan-freshness.ts` + edits to `scheduler.ts`, `scan-singleflight.ts`, `db-learning.ts`, `app/api/scan/route.ts`, `.env.example` (knob `MARKET_SCAN_FRESHNESS_MAX_AGE_HOURS`), NEW `test/market-scan-freshness.test.ts` (unrun).
- Lane E (UM): NEW `src/lib/usage-monitor-knobs.ts` (subscriptions→knob lane) + edits to `usage-budget.ts` (forecast fields), `provider-rate-limit.ts` (knob hook), `data-providers.ts` (telemetry for CongressTrade/Webull/SecXbrl providers), tests updated (unrun).
- Treat every Stage-2 file as UNREVIEWED: agents died mid-edit; completeness unknown even though types check.

**Not started:** Stage 3 (Lane C freshness UI; Lane F provider wins incl. sharesOutstanding→CT refs + AV/FMP fixes + RapidAPI refund-on-403), Stooq-tier degradation in `history.ts` (research found Stooq behind a PoW bot wall — do not integrate/keep; degrade gracefully), full gates, land.

## 3. Decisions & Trade-offs

All pause-#1 decisions stand. New: (a) AG-context addendum baked into the workflow script RULES (locate code by symbol not line; preserve history.ts metering; make `fetchNasdaqScreenerRefs` reuse the cached screener; attach sharesOutstanding to refs); (b) partial Stage-2 committed rather than discarded — cheap to inspect, cheap to reset.

## 4. Verification State

- Stage 1: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean + targeted vitest green (verify agent) → committed.
- Stage 2 partial: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (verified at pause). **No test run. No lint. No build. Full 4-gate suite has NOT run on this branch.**
- Prod (no mutations made this session): healthy at main HEAD after peer-MONET's webhook restoration (~04:47Z receipt in #agent-sync); deploy queue rows 96-98 finished, 99/100 (dup commit b7d88e42) in flight at pause; row 101 failure = different app (compose buildpack). UptimeRobot incident ~04:11Z was transient CPU starvation under double build — app container never died.

## 5. Next Steps & Blockers (exact resume path)

1. Inspect the Stage-2 WIP diff (`git show <wip sha>`). EITHER finish Lanes B/E by hand (both new modules exist; check each against the lane specs in the workflow script) OR `git restore` the Stage-2 files back to `7d552c8e` and re-run the workflow.
2. Workflow resume: script `.../workflows/scripts/data-cascade-implementation-wf_5ce762cb-82f.js`, last runId `wf_03eeb635-178` (Stage-1 agents cache-replay; Stage-2 lanes re-run — NOTE the worktree already contains their partial edits unless you reset first; resetting first is the safer default).
3. Then Stage 3 (Lanes C+F), + small follow-up: degrade Stooq tier in history.ts.
4. Full gates (`npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, Node 24 PATH), rollout note, STATUS.md, EFFORT-LOG both boards, land via `scripts/land.sh` (merge will queue behind whatever the deploy queue holds).
5. **Owner actions** (unchanged from pause-#1 §5 plus research additions): Tiingo free Starter key → Connections (zero code, already-built provider); Quiver fleet key activation decision ($30/mo Hobbyist already paid fleet-side); CONGRESS_SHARE_FUNDAMENTALS_ENABLED / CONGRESS_TRADE_FUNDAMENTALS_ENABLED / CONGRESS_SHARE_ENABLED prod flips; APP_B_INGEST_TOKEN bearer smoke test; UM push env check (`usage-monitor: ok=false` while UM healthy — note unauthenticated /api/health is now minimized post-#2341, so verify via authed path); Nasdaq-calendar ToS acceptance; FMP Starter (~$22/mo) if forward analyst estimates are wanted (nothing free exists).

## 6. Zero-Code Findings

- **Free-tier research (COMPLETE, 23 agents):** `docs/market-data-free-tier-research-2026-08-02.md` — ranked new sources (Treasury XML, Nasdaq calendars, FRED w/ no-DB-cache ToU, FINRA short interest, Wisesheets, BLS, SimFin, Marketaux, USAspending, S&P constituents PDDL), underused existing providers (Tiingo/SEC-EDGAR/Alpaca-options-greeks/Finnhub-calendars/AV-corp-actions/Cboe-VVIX/TwelveData-self-adjusted/Yahoo-hardening), the owner-requested NOT-free table (11 data types w/ cheapest paid), and license cautions (only gov sources are commercial-clean; Stooq dead behind bot wall; Nasdaq ToS AI-extraction clause affects our existing screener dependency).
- **AG takeover verification:** #2337 (universe refs push) + #2342 (OHLC metering + peer-route rate limits) merged pre-resume; #2343 verified sound and merged by me. AG works out of the main integration tree (`/Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade`) against repo rules — flagged, not policed. The uncommitted `derive.ts`/`benchmark.ts` edits seen on `antigravity/monet-fixes` at session start never landed anywhere and are gone from that tree.
- **Deploy-pipeline context:** peer MONET session root-caused webhook HMAC drift and restored auto-deploy with receipts; queue behaved (serialized, self-drained) throughout — the "dual in_progress" signature during their redeliveries resolved without intervention both times.
