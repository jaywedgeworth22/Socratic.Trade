# 2026-09-07 - congress-share 401 observability + auth circuit breaker

## Summary

- ST's highest-volume live production error, first-hand from `/app/data/litestream-runtime.log`
  on the prod host: `[congress-share] import failed: HTTP 401 {"error":"unauthorized"}` —
  3,096 occurrences, continuous 2026-08-29T15:55Z through 2026-09-07T14:11Z, still firing at the
  last log line. Logged with `console.error` ONLY — no Sentry, no health signal, no alert, no
  backoff, for nine days and getting worse (a 2026-08-31 board audit recorded 914x/48h; the rate
  has climbed since). Board row `8620cad8` (P1).
- Root defect was NOT "the token happens to be wrong" (that is an operator action, see below) —
  it was that `shareWithCongressTrade` (the single choke point every congress-share caller funnels
  through) had no observability and no circuit breaker, so a permanent auth failure retried at
  full cadence forever with zero automated visibility.
- Fixed the observability hole: every attempt now logs into the shared `api_health_log` pipeline
  via `logApiHealth`, the SAME generic mechanism "roic" and "congress.trade" already use to
  surface a degraded `/api/health` dependency and (after 5 consecutive hard failures) a Sentry
  capture + admin alert — no new alerting code, just plugged into the existing one.
- Added an auth-specific circuit breaker: HTTP 401/403 (permanent failure — the shared bearer
  token is wrong) trips a 6h (configurable) cooldown that short-circuits the network call for
  every subsequent caller (scan-hook + the rest of an in-flight nightly-batch chunk loop + future
  runs) until the cooldown elapses, at which point one real probe is allowed through. A
  transient failure (5xx/timeout/network) does NOT trip it — those stay on the existing
  per-caller backoff (the nightly batch already had its own generic 60-minute failure backoff).
  While tripped, the cached failure is still replayed into the health log at the caller's normal
  cadence (no live retry) so the 5-consecutive-failure Sentry/degraded threshold is still reached
  quickly instead of only once per cooldown window.

## Why

Diagnosed the token via non-secret fingerprint comparison ONLY (length + sha256 prefix; no value
ever printed) across Infisical prod for both apps:

- ST Infisical prod (`socratic-trade`, project `39d93bb7-76f9-498c-8b50-a7def52e072f`)
  `CONGRESS_TRADE_TOKEN`: len=64, sha256[:16]=`7b45501aca28f360`
- CT Infisical prod (`congress-trade-6-erm`, project `f61a79de-8d77-4f0b-9361-4b7208598290`)
  `INGEST_TOKEN`: len=64, sha256[:16]=`202ed3f3e0449633`
- CT Infisical prod `ADMIN_TOKEN`: len=64, sha256[:16]=`9290fbbb012e9914`

ST's token matches NEITHER of CT's two candidate ingest tokens. **CONFIRMED: token drift** — the
shared bearer token has diverged between the two apps' Infisical prod projects. This is the
proximate cause of the 401s. Rotating/resyncing the credential is an OWNER action (see Follow-ups
below); this rollout does not touch it. The production container itself was not reachable for a
third fingerprint (no SSH/Tailscale from this session) — Infisical prod is what Coolify injects
into the container at boot (per `/Users/jay/apps/COOLIFY.md`), so the Infisical-level mismatch is
the operative one regardless.

Independent of the token, nine days of a money-adjacent integration being completely dead with
nobody paged is a real defect on its own — the fix in this rollout stands regardless of when/how
the token gets resynced, and prevents the next auth drift (or any other 401-shaped failure) from
being silent again.

## Files

- `src/lib/congress-share.ts` — `logApiHealth` import; `AUTH_BREAKER_KEY` +
  `CongressAuthBreakerState` + `authBreakerCooldownMs`/`readCongressAuthBreakerState`/
  `isCongressAuthBreakerTripped`/`tripCongressAuthBreaker`/`clearCongressAuthBreaker`/
  `resetCongressAuthBreakerForTests`; `shareWithCongressTrade` now checks the breaker before
  every network attempt, logs ok/fail to `api_health_log` (service `congress-share`, keySource
  `env`) on every real attempt and every breaker-absorbed attempt, and trips/clears the breaker
  on 401/403 vs success respectively.
- `app/api/admin/connections-health/route.ts` — added `{ service: "congress-share", keySource:
  "env" }` to `EXPECTED_BACKEND_LANES` so the admin Connections UI always shows a card for this
  lane instead of only appearing after the first logged failure.
- `test/congress-share.test.ts` — new tests: health-log rows on success/failure, breaker trips on
  401/403 and short-circuits the very next call (no fetch), breaker does NOT trip on 5xx/transport
  errors, breaker-absorbed calls still replay into the health log, and the breaker clears + resumes
  real sends after the cooldown elapses and a probe succeeds. `beforeEach` now also resets the
  breaker (`resetCongressAuthBreakerForTests()`).
- `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`, `/Users/jay/apps/TRADING-EFFORT-LOG.md`, `STATUS.md`, `PLAN.md` — handoff
  records for this lane.

## Decisions & Trade-offs

- No new alerting code. `logApiHealth` -> `alertConnectionFailure` -> Sentry `captureMessage` +
  `deliverSystemAlertToAdmins` already exists and already gates on the same "5 consecutive hard
  failures" heuristic the rest of the codebase relies on to avoid single-blip noise (see
  `db-health.ts`'s own header comment on why). Building a parallel/bespoke alert for this one lane
  would have reintroduced exactly the "two uncoordinated alerts for one event" problem `db-health.ts`
  already documents having fixed once (2026-07-07, RAG lanes).
- The breaker is a SINGLE shared circuit for the whole module, keyed off the fact that every
  outbound caller (the after-scan hook, the nightly batch's chunked payload loop, any future
  caller) already funnels through `shareWithCongressTrade`. Tripping it once silences the whole
  storm without needing separate gating per caller.
- Chose to keep replaying the cached failure into the health log while the breaker is tripped
  (rather than going fully silent) so the existing 5-consecutive-failure Sentry threshold is still
  reached at the caller's normal cadence (e.g. within a few scans), not delayed until 5 real
  cooldown-gated probes have failed (which at a 6h default cooldown would take ~30 hours). The
  trade-off: while tripped, `/api/health`'s `congress-share` dependency reflects the LAST real
  HTTP response, not a fresh one, for up to one cooldown window — acceptable since a circuit
  breaker inherently trades monitoring freshness for not hammering a known-broken endpoint, and the
  cooldown is configurable (`CONGRESS_SHARE_AUTH_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_MS`).
- 401 and 403 both trip the breaker (both are auth-class, permanent-until-fixed failures); 5xx and
  network/timeout errors do not, since those may well be transient (matches how the nightly batch's
  own existing 60-minute generic failure backoff already treats "some failure" without
  distinguishing cause — this adds the missing cause-specific fast path on top of it).
- Did not touch the public `/api/health` route itself — "roic" and "congress.trade" get their
  dependency entries purely from the generic `getServiceHealthSummaries()` walk over
  `api_health_log`, with no service-specific code in `route.ts`. Logging into that same table with
  service `congress-share` reproduces the exact same pattern with zero route.ts changes.

## Verification State

- `npx tsc --noEmit` (via `node@24`, matching `.nvmrc`)
- `npm test` (vitest) — full suite, plus targeted `test/congress-share.test.ts`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Exact output pasted into the PR / final report.

## Next Steps & Blockers

- **Owner action required — credential resync.** ST's `CONGRESS_TRADE_TOKEN` (Infisical prod,
  `socratic-trade` project) does not match CT's `INGEST_TOKEN` or `ADMIN_TOKEN` (Infisical prod,
  `congress-trade-6-erm` project). Someone needs to decide which side is authoritative and either:
  1. Copy CT's current `INGEST_TOKEN` (or `ADMIN_TOKEN`, whichever CT's
     `/api/admin/securities/import` verifier actually checks) value into ST's
     `CONGRESS_TRADE_TOKEN` in Infisical prod, or
  2. Rotate CT's ingest token and update ST's `CONGRESS_TRADE_TOKEN` to match.
  Then restart the ST Coolify container (`d83b1aykr03uwr32yhgzaiay`) so it re-reads Infisical at
  boot. This rollout deliberately does not perform that rotation/resync (secret-safety + owner
  action boundary).
- After the resync, `/api/health`'s `dependencies.congress-share` should read `ok: true` (or not
  appear until the next real attempt); the admin Connections page card for "congress-share" should
  clear.
