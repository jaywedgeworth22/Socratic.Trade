# 2026-06-30 — Strategy Review Persistence & Test Quote Fallback

## Summary
- Added `localStorage` persistence for the Strategy Studio LLM review tuning proposal so it is not lost on page refresh or slide-over closure.
- Added a "Discard review" button to `TuningCard` allowing users to manually clear the strategy tuning proposal card and state.
- Modified `TestBrokerGateway.getEquityQuotes` to gracefully fall back to a simulated price (100.00) instead of throwing an error when real-time quotes from Yahoo Finance are unavailable/rate-limited for test/paper positions.

## Why
1. Running LLM strategy tuning reviews costs API tokens and money; losing the review proposal whenever the Strategy Studio modal or page is refreshed forces duplicate runs and wastes money. Storing the proposal in `localStorage` and restoring it on mount preserves it safely.
2. In the local simulated "Test" account environment (which has no real broker API/positions), if a user had a position in a symbol like BAC and Yahoo Finance's scraping/free endpoint rate-limited or failed, the gateway threw an error. This error cascaded and broke the entire dashboard's active account/portfolio loading, displaying "Real-time quote for symbol BAC is unavailable." under Decisions. Gracefully returning a mock quote prevents this cascading failure in local test simulations.

## Files
- `app/dashboard-client.tsx` — integrated `localStorage` sync effects and passed `discardStrategyTuning` callback to `TuningCard` from `StrategyView` and `StrategyStudio`.
- `src/lib/robinhood.ts` — updated `TestBrokerGateway.getEquityQuotes` to return a `test-fallback` quote for missing symbols rather than throwing.
- `docs/rollouts/2026-06-30-antigravity-strategy-review-localstorage.md` — this rollout note.

## Verification
- `npm test` — ran all 161 test files (1,561 tests), all passed successfully.
- Verified that local simulated/test accounts load positions without crashing even if Yahoo Finance quote fetching fails/degrades.
