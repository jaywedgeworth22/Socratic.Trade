# 2026-06-22 — SEO foundation + flag-gated landing page (launch prep)

## Summary

Prepared the app for a possible public launch **without exposing anything yet**: added an
SEO foundation that is **noindex by default**, and a compliant, education-led **landing
page** that is **off by default** (404 until a flag is set). Also captured the full
go-to-market research + decisions in `docs/go-to-market.md`. The owner may or may not go
public — every default here keeps the app private until explicitly flipped.

## Why

From the 2026-06-22 deep-research run: the product's "live-trading/investment service"
framing trips ad-platform bans and raises SEC/RIA exposure, while a research/paper/
education framing avoids both and unlocks the best awareness channels. Positioning
decision: market it as AI market-research / analytics / paper-trading, with live mode
present but never the headline. See `docs/go-to-market.md` and the `gtm-positioning-and-prep`
memory.

## Files

- `app/layout.tsx` — replaced the 2-line `metadata` with full SEO metadata: `metadataBase`
  (env `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, default `https://trading.jays.services`), title template,
  compliance-safe description, keywords, canonical, OpenGraph, Twitter, and **env-gated
  robots** (noindex/nofollow unless `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING=true`). `viewport` + layout
  body unchanged.
- `app/robots.ts` (new) — disallow-all by default; when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING=true`,
  allow only `/welcome`, disallow `/`, `/api/`, `/access-denied`, and point to the sitemap.
- `app/sitemap.ts` (new) — single `/welcome` entry (the app itself is gated).
- `app/welcome/page.tsx` (new) — flag-gated server component
  (`LANDING_PAGE_ENABLED !== "true"` → `notFound()`); hero, features grid, how-it-works,
  prominent **disclosures** card (not investment advice / not a broker-dealer or RIA / risk
  of loss / simulated ≠ future results / consult a pro), footer, JSON-LD
  (`SoftwareApplication`). Uses `Button`/`Card` primitives + design tokens. Page-level
  metadata with the same env-gated robots.
- `middleware.ts` — added `"/welcome"` to `PUBLIC_PREFIXES` (reachable without auth when
  enabled; 404s when the flag is off regardless).
- `.env.example` — documented `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING`,
  `LANDING_PAGE_ENABLED` (all default to the private/safe state).
- `docs/go-to-market.md` (new) — research synthesis, verified ad/SEO/compliance
  constraints, 30-day playbook, done/partial/deferred checklist, sources.

Build delegated to a Sonnet subagent (cheapest model that does the job well); docs +
memory + verification + landing by the orchestrator.

## Verification

Isolated worktree `~/Code/agentic-trading-queue` off `origin/main`:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean
- `npm test` (vitest) — **804 passed, 90 files** (middleware change broke nothing)
- `npm run build` — green (compiled the new `robots`/`sitemap`/`welcome` routes + metadata)

## Decisions / notes

- **Private by default** is deliberate: `LANDING_PAGE_ENABLED` off → `/welcome` 404s;
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING` off → every page noindex + robots disallow-all. Go-public =
  flip those two (+ set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) and submit the sitemap to Search Console.
- **No public demo built** — Test mode's simulator runs inside the authed app; a public
  no-signup demo needs an unauthenticated, sandboxed surface (auth + abuse controls), which
  exceeds the "super easy" bar. Documented as the biggest deferred awareness unlock.

## Follow-ups

- Minor: the CTA wraps `<Button>` (a `<button>`) in an `<a>` — functional but not ideal
  HTML; could switch to an anchor-styled button later.
- Owner: securities-counsel review of RIA / SEC Marketing-Rule before any live-trading
  marketing; verify Meta/X/Bing ad policies before spend; write SEO content (slow).
