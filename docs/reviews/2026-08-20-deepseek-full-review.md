# Full-Stack Review — Desktop Web + Mobile Web + iOS (DEEPSEEK, 2026-08-20)

Owner-directed top-to-bottom review of Socratic.Trade across the desktop website, the phone-width website, and the native iOS app.  This review complements (does not replace) the 2026-08-18 MONET expert review (`docs/reviews/2026-08-18-full-app-expert-review.md`), the 2026-08-17 architecture/backend and brokers/data-cascade audits (`docs/audits/`), and the open Kimi board findings.  Where a known finding was re-checked against current `main` (`41a7a438d` at review start), this document records the CURRENT state (fixed / still open / narrowed) so nobody re-files or re-fixes stale claims.

Board: umbrella item `682e7e3467cd4def97a13ee67335cbb1` (claimed by DEEPSEEK).  New findings are filed individually as `review-finding` items.

## 0. Method

- Four parallel review tracks were launched (desktop web, mobile web, iOS Swift, backend/ops), each grounded on the clean lane `~/apps/trading-deepseek` at `origin/main` HEAD `41a7a438d` (2026-08-20).  **All four stalled on model calls and were interrupted after ~85 minutes with no reports**; the outline below therefore rests on the first-hand live/code measurements in this document, cross-checked against the 2026-08-18 expert review and the open Kimi board findings.  Re-running the deep-dive tracks is a listed follow-up (P3) rather than a blocker.
- Live production measurements: HTTP headers, robots.txt, meta tags, Lighthouse (desktop + mobile) against `https://socratictrade.com/login`, `/api/health` sha vs `origin/main`.
- Cross-checked against the shared board (`board list --app socratic-trade --status open`) so no finding duplicates an open item; state-changes on open items are recorded here and on the board as comments.

## 1. Live production state (measured 2026-08-20 ~21:10–21:40 CDT)

- **Production is 8 commits behind `origin/main`.**  `/api/health` reports release sha `e0a4959a`; `origin/main` is `41a7a438d`.  Not-yet-live: #2973 (broker cancel/timeout), #2947 (Tradier paging), #2959 (intraday 502), #2817 (RTH deploy latch), #2974 (iOS/web parity), #2785 (favicon crop), #2795 (console chip AA), #2975 (effort log).  Consequence: several fixes below are NOT observable on the live site yet; any "verify live" step must re-check the sha first (`bash scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh`).
- **Live `GET /icon.png` is still ~1.0 MB** (etag `W/"f4530-..."` ≈ 1,001,264 bytes) — the pre-crop icon.  `main`'s regenerated `public/icon.png` is 160 KB.  Deploying #2785 fixes this; until then the login page ships a 1 MB PNG as its largest asset.
- **The entire public surface is the sign-in page.**  `GET /` → 307 → `/login`; `robots.txt` disallows everything (`User-Agent: *` `Disallow: /`, plus explicit AI-crawler blocks); every page is `noindex, nofollow`.  There is no landing/marketing page, no public docs surface, no SEO presence.  Consistent with a single-operator app, but the owner should confirm this is intended (it also means the App Store listing is the only public marketing surface).
- **Security headers are strong:** HSTS (2y, preload), `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy`, Cloudflare NEL.  **CSP is report-only** (`content-security-policy-report-only` with `'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'`) — worth a progressive-enforcement program (see findings).
- **Lighthouse (anonymous login page):** desktop perf 96 / a11y 100 / best-practices 96 (LCP 1.0 s, TBT 10 ms, CLS 0).  Mobile perf 66 / a11y 100 / BP 96 (LCP 8.3 s, TBT 250 ms, interactive 8.4 s).  The mobile gap is driven by the 1 MB `icon.png` (1.4 MB total page weight) plus ~330 KB of JS chunks with ~162 KiB unused.
- **Scheduler/broker health (live):** `/api/health` ok; scheduler ticking (age 32 s), 2 active accounts, 2 autopilot, market closed, `tradingLivenessDegraded: false`.  No live-watch issues observed.
- **Merge gate:** the `main-protection` ruleset requires exactly ONE status check: `verify` (tsc → vitest → next build).  `ios-build.yml` exists (Mac runner, unsigned build on `ios/**` PRs) but is NOT a required check — open board finding `830c892f` confirmed on current main.

## 2. State verifications of open board findings (as of main 41a7a438d)

| Board id | Finding | Current state on main |
|---|---|---|
| 89249c60 | Swift decoders drift from route payloads | **Specific defect FIXED**: `DeskModels.swift:368-373` decodes nested `riskRules` with top-level fallback.  Systemic part (no API→iOS contract test) still open. |
| 3b343933 | iOS shows previous account's data after sign-out | **Specific defect FIXED on main**: `MobileStore.swift:686` `signOut()` withdraws the push token and clears the local session (`clearLocalSession`).  Verify the shipped TestFlight binary carries it. |
| 830c892f | Merge gate never compiles iOS | **Confirmed still open**: only `verify` is a required check; `ios-build` is not in the ruleset.  Fix is a one-line ruleset change (add `ios-build` as required status check). |
| 410bda84 | iOS privacy manifest missing | **Confirmed still open**: no `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` anywhere in `ios/` (grep of `project.yml` + sources). |
| 2056ceab | Tone tokens fail WCAG AA | Partially addressed by #2795 (chip AA, live only after deploy); re-audit remaining tones after prod catches up. |
| LIVE-02 (expert review) | Bare 404 page inside console shell | **Confirmed still open**: no `app/not-found.tsx` / `app/console/not-found.tsx`; `/console/proposals` (nav label "Proposals" → `/console/approvals`) renders Next's stock 404. |

## 4. Prioritized fix/improvement outline (DEEPSEEK, current main)

Priorities: P0 = correctness/money-path/blocking; P1 = significant; P2 = polish/hygiene; P3 = nice-to-have; P4 = observation.  Open Kimi/expert-review items are referenced by board id / cluster key — this list does not re-file them; it adds what is NEW and orders the whole.

### P0 (money-path / correctness — mostly owned, reference only)
- The 12+ open P1 board findings from the Kimi audit are the money-path truth (broker I/O 28996d82, cancel-replace ownership 23f0ca01, quote asOf fabrication 009b99f0, approve-success misreport d2094c78, price-alert silence d97c8726, day-P&L flows 0706c22a, identity fail-open 6c36b9be, event-loop pins 937c3b0a/2967, RAG run hang 2961, migration PRAGMA check 2964, Alpaca socket leak 2970).  Nothing here supersedes them; the outline below assumes they land as claimed.

### P1 (significant — new or state-changed)
1. **Merge gate must compile the iOS app (state-changed).**  Confirmed on current main: the `main-protection` ruleset requires exactly `verify`; `ios-build.yml` exists but is not required.  One-line ruleset fix (add `ios-build` required status check) closes board 830c892f.  Effort: S.  This is the cheapest systemic win on the board.
2. **Production is 8 commits behind main — close the gap deliberately.**  Live sha `e0a4959a` vs `origin/main` `41a7a438d`; the not-yet-live set includes #2973 (broker cancel/timeouts), #2947 (Tradier paging), #2959 (intraday 502), #2974 (iOS/web parity), #2785 (favicon — the live 1 MB `icon.png`), #2795 (console chip AA), #2817 (RTH latch).  The RTH deploy latch deliberately pauses deploys in market hours; this backlog is the expected consequence, but the owner should verify the sha once the latch window opens (`bash scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh`).  Effort: S (ops).
3. **CSP enforcement program.**  CSP is report-only with `'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'` (live headers).  Worth: monitor `report-uri /api/csp-report` for a week, then tighten incrementally (remove `unsafe-eval`, then inline).  Effort: M across the repo; P2 security value, listed P1 because it is the one live header weakness in an otherwise strong set.
4. **Mobile first-paint on the public surface.**  Lighthouse mobile on `/login`: perf 66, LCP 8.3 s, interactive 8.4 s vs desktop 96/1.0 s.  Drivers: 1 MB `icon.png` (fixed in main by #2785 but not deployed — after deploy re-measure), ~330 KB JS with 162 KiB unused, font loading.  Follow-ups: preload the LCP image, trim unused chunk code, consider AVIF/WebP for icons.  Effort: S-M.

### P2 (polish/hygiene)
5. **Custom 404 pages (confirmed still open).**  No `app/not-found.tsx` / `app/console/not-found.tsx`; `/console/proposals` (nav label "Proposals" → `/console/approvals`) renders Next's stock 404 with no chrome.  Fix: console-scoped not-found + redirect alias for `/console/proposals`.  Effort: S.
6. **iOS privacy manifest (confirmed still open, board 410bda84).**  No `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` in `ios/`; add the standard manifest (UserDefaults/network reasons) before the next TestFlight so the App Store review doesn't bounce.  Effort: S.
7. **Two-space sentence rule — finish the enforcement (in flight).**  `SENTENCE_GAP` exists in `app/console/lib/format.ts` and is used in `chrome.tsx`/`proposal-scorecard.tsx`; PR #2971 (monet/copy-rules-lint) is open to enforce the rest.  Verify iOS strings too (`UserFacingCopyTests.swift` covers some).  Effort: M (mostly mechanical).
8. **Light-theme default verified OK on web** (`useConsoleTheme` returns light on first visit; console-scoped key; `data-theme` never clashes with legacy `.dark`).  Keep the iOS app at light default too (verify the current binary).
9. **State updates for board findings already fixed on main:** 89249c60 (riskRules decoder now nests correctly — systemic contract-test part still open) and 3b343933 (sign-out clears the session snapshot on main).  Comment both on the board so the queue doesn't re-fix them.

### P3 (nice-to-have)
10. **Public landing surface (decision, not defect).**  `GET /` → 307 → `/login`, all pages `noindex`, robots disallows everything — the entire public web presence is the sign-in page.  For a single-operator app this is defensible; if the owner ever wants the App Store listing backed by a matching web story, a small public page (`/about` or a landing at `/`) with the same metadata already present in `app/layout.tsx` would be the minimal move.  Effort: S-M.
11. **`/console/proposals` alias** (folded into #5).
12. **Login-page asset hygiene**: the 1 MB icon and unused JS are the only real weight on the public page; after #2785 deploys, re-run Lighthouse mobile to confirm.

### P4 (observations)
13. Robots.txt blocks all AI crawlers — consistent with a private app; no change needed.
14. `viewport` meta, `themeColor` lockstep, `interactiveWidget: resizes-content` are all correct in `app/console/layout.tsx` — good mobile chrome hygiene.
15. The dashboard data layer (`useConsoleData.tsx`) has strong coalescing/abort discipline (SSE + poll + visibility gating + slow-load notice) — the "blocking snapshot" concern (board f61404ec) is partly mitigated; re-audit after prod catches up.

## 3. New findings (filed on the board)

- `da8a93bf` (P2) — Console renders bare Next.js 404 pages; `/console/proposals` label/route mismatch.
- `34b8fbe7` (P2) — CSP is report-only with unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval on the live site.
- `436a9b98` (P2) — Production is 8 commits behind main; live login page ships the 1 MB pre-crop icon (mobile LCP 8.3 s).

State comments added on the board: `830c892f` (ruleset needs ios-build as a required check), `89249c60` + `3b343933` (both confirmed fixed on main; systemic parts remain), `620ef423` (sign-in drops deep-link destination; `redirectTo: "/"` hardcoded in all three OAuth server actions; plus the 401 stale-data freeze mechanism from the mobile track).

## 5. Backend / API / Ops / Docs track — COMPLETED (report committed)

The backend deep-dive completed after the first pass and is committed in full: `docs/audits/2026-08-20-deepseek-backend-ops-docs.md` (plus detail reports `2026-08-20-deepseek-api-routes.md`, `2026-08-20-deepseek-scripts.md`, `2026-08-20-deepseek-docs.md`).  Verdict: **no P0, no unguarded money-path bug** — the exit-code contract, admin gate (all 26 routes), identity chain, scheduler lease/lane guards, and broker-I/O deadline discipline all hold under direct inspection.  New board filings from this track: `99ab01c7` (P1 drain exits 0 on failed nudge), `8c9ce3b9` (P1 deployment.md mislabels live replica as R2 — live is B2), `220c6cc6` (P2 watchdog pages on latched RTH merges), `68d11cc9` (P2 retired-lane scripts shipped), `7db3350e` (P2 ops doc stale topology), `3a8bcdcf` (P3 from-draft rate limit gap), `d6f0a9d3` (P3 API error honesty), `cc0caa64` (P3 checkBrokerHealth inline, no tick deadline), `51c52fd6` (P3 /api/health public + heavy), `67558af0` (P3 quotes asOf = serve time).

Quick wins from the track (S-effort each): `exit 1` in `scripts/rth-deploy-drain.sh` on `nudge_ok=0`; rewrite `docs/deployment.md:70-81` R2→B2 framing; add the orders rate limit to `/api/proposals/from-draft`; 502 `{error}` on `/api/history` failure and broker-backed GETs; RTH-latch awareness in `alert-deploy-freshness.sh` (M).

## 6. Desktop web track — COMPLETED (report committed)

`docs/audits/2026-08-20-deepseek-desktop-web.md` — 45 findings (2 P1, 12 P2, 17 P3, 14 P4), no P0.  P1s filed as `cf62f87a` (legacy NULL-executionMode proposals can never pass typed confirmation on a live account — client resolves "live" from the row stamp while the server 409s from the current account; card also mislabels "NO ACCOUNT"; same root in bulk approve) and `c53ad066` (Guardrails Discard does not clear the Universe-group `universeDraft` — discarded edits resurface in the next commit on the page governing what gets scanned/traded).  P2 filings: `28c50b28` (no per-page tab titles), `f49c871b` (evidence sheet can attach the latest run's rows to an unrelated older decision), `9fdfa035` (inert Coach quick-action chips), `adc4ec5b` (Send-test races the auto-save queue), `cdee1562` (read notifications below AA: 4.24:1/2.79:1), `7e93bbcc` (legal pages CDN-cached one year).  Verified strengths: dead-controls cluster genuinely wired, home rows use persisted ids, tone tokens pass AA in both themes, coalesced polling sane, watchlist optimistic star reverts.

## 7. iOS track — COMPLETED (report committed; xcodebuild verified)

`docs/audits/2026-08-20-deepseek-ios.md` — no P0; `xcodebuild build` and the test-target compile BOTH pass clean on main.  P1 filings: `d9f81e44` (Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues:) traps on duplicate command ids — server-data crash on every reconcile).  P2 filings: `179cc4b2` (one failed reload flips the staleness gate and disables Approve/Run/Watchlist/Policy with no SSE-fallback polling), `06edecc0` (@Observable rule violated — ObservableObject/@Published in three stores).  P3 filings: `7035a2ba` (version record drift: project.yml 1.0.8 vs TestFlight 1.0.68), `1dbdc227` (no 5xx retry; fixed-size chrome ignores Dynamic Type; sub-44pt targets; SSE event storms reload everything).  State comments: `64f21332` ~⅓ closed (list of remaining read-only gaps), `2056ceab` iOS half still open (system green ≈2.4:1), `ce75f8d0` three new mechanisms, `89249c60` re-verified (riskRules fixed; no-contract-test program still open).  App Store blocker: privacy manifest still absent (`410bda84`, confirmed again).

## 8. Mobile web track — COMPLETED (report committed)

`docs/audits/2026-08-20-deepseek-mobile-web.md` — 12 findings (1 P1, 7 P2, 3 P3, 1 P4).  The merged phone-touch-viewport cluster landed most of its four promises; the remaining gaps are documented on `bf05f16a` (avatar trigger hard-capped 32×32 by an inline style beating the 44px floor; Segmented/checkbox/summary/theme-picker below 44px; 320px scope collapse with no overflow-x guard) and `acc07df6` (still open: no phone type-scale — 424×11px / 188×12.5px / 13×10px uses; ~70px equity chart; unvirtualized scan card wall with no sort/filter while the desktop tree stays mounted; two gradient orbs animating under the opaque console; Coach composer Enter-always-sends on touch keyboards).  P1: `620ef423` deepened — an expired session 401s forever with zero 401 special-casing in the console fetch client, freezing the console on stale data with no route to /login (worse on a phone).  Caveat: console is auth-walled, so layout claims are static analysis + arithmetic; live probes of the /login surface were clean (no overflow at 320/390/430, zoom stays enabled, no 100vh anywhere).

## 9. What to claim next (board items, in order)

1. `cf62f87a` (P1, S-M) + `c53ad066` (P1, S) — the two desktop money-path P1s.
2. `99ab01c7` (P1, S) — drain exit 1 on failed nudge; `8c9ce3b9` (P1, S) — deployment.md R2→B2 rewrite.
3. `830c892f` (P1, S) — make ios-build a required check; `410bda84` (P1, S) — privacy manifest.
4. `d9f81e44` (P1, S) — iOS dictionary crash; `179cc4b2` (P2, M) — staleness gate decouple.
5. The P2 batch: `28c50b28` tab titles, `cdee1562` read-opacity, `7e93bbcc` legal cache, `3a8bcdcf` from-draft rate limit, `d6f0a9d3` API error honesty, `220c6cc6` watchdog RTH awareness (M), `34b8fbe7` CSP enforcement (M), `68d11cc9` retired-lane script deletions, `7db3350e` ops doc rewrite, mobile `bf05f16a`/`acc07df6` remnants.

## 10. HANDOFF (owner direction 2026-08-21)

Owner directed that DEEPSEEK not implement fixes; the review is complete and is handed to the fleet as actionable instructions.  **See `docs/handoffs/2026-08-21-deepseek-review-handoff.md`** (master note: claim protocol, full work list with board ids, first-wave suggestions) and the per-area handoff files `docs/handoffs/2026-08-21-{desktop-web,mobile-web,ios,backend-ops}-handoff.md` (exact file:line anchors, fix approach, failing-first tests, verify commands, pitfalls, avoid-lists).  All findings are on the board — `board claim <id>` before work; do not re-file.
