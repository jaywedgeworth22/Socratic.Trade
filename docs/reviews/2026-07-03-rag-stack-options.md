# RAG stack options for Socratic Trade

Date: 2026-07-03

Context: owner asked whether Gemini's suggested beginner RAG stack should change Socratic Trade's
production RAG design, and whether a fresh Pinecone Starter quota can be protected before new keys
are connected.

## Decision

Keep the current default: **Voyage finance embeddings + Pinecone serverless + Voyage rerank**.

This app is not a generic tutorial chatbot. It is a finance/trading system where retrieval quality
depends on finance-specific language, point-in-time source handling, provenance, write controls, and
auditable decision memory. The existing runtime already uses `voyage-finance-2`, Pinecone, and
`rerank-2.5` directly; it does not use LangChain or LlamaIndex as core dependencies.

## Why this is the best default

- Voyage has finance-domain embeddings already matched to the current 1024-dimensional Pinecone
  index. Switching embedding models requires a new index and a full re-embed.
- Voyage rerank is already wired as the quality layer after dense retrieval; reranking is the higher
  leverage quality move than swapping orchestration frameworks.
- Pinecone is the right managed default for a small production app because it avoids running vector
  infrastructure and already supports the current metadata/filter model.
- The codebase already implements the domain-specific parts a generic framework would not solve for
  us: chunking, content-hash dedup, as-of filtering, tenant scope, source metadata, API health,
  metering, and admin coverage views.

## Consider later

- **OpenAI embeddings**: credible fallback or A/B baseline, especially if vendor consolidation matters.
  Do not swap by default; there is no finance-specific default advantage, and dimensions/indexes must
  be migrated deliberately.
- **Cohere Embed/Rerank**: credible enterprise alternative, especially for multilingual/semi-structured
  rerank use. Benchmark against our actual filings and strategy questions before switching.
- **Weaviate**: consider only if its built-in hybrid/platform features become more valuable than
  Pinecone's managed simplicity. This is a platform migration.
- **LlamaIndex**: useful if document ingestion/query-engine abstraction becomes the bottleneck. Today
  the custom ingestion path is already tailored to SEC filings and decision memory.
- **LangChain**: useful for generic RAG/agent experiments, not a production requirement for this stack.

## Avoid for now

- Do not migrate to Chroma as the production store. It is fine for local experiments, but it weakens
  managed production operations and quota visibility.
- Do not add LangChain/LlamaIndex just to say the app uses a framework. That adds dependency surface
  without fixing retrieval precision, corpus quality, or quota waste.
- Do not switch away from Voyage finance embeddings without a gold-set retrieval benchmark and a planned
  reindex.
- Do not upgrade Pinecone to mask write leakage. Fix idempotency, batching, dashboards, and write fuses
  first.

## Current write paths that can spend Pinecone/Voyage quota

- `src/lib/scheduler.ts` calls `refreshFilingBodies`, which can ingest 10-K/10-Q body chunks.
- `src/lib/web-sources/sec8k.ts` writes 8-K summaries and optional full 8-K bodies.
- `src/lib/web-sources/disclosure-rag.ts` writes congress and insider disclosure documents when enabled.
- `src/lib/socratic-memory.ts` writes Socratic decision memory.
- Admin reindex routes can trigger manual backfills.

## Required safeguards before fresh Pinecone keys

- Keep `RAG_INGEST_BUDGET_ENABLED=on`.
- Keep `RAG_INGEST_MAX_TEXTS_PER_DAY=1000` until corpus growth is intentionally planned.
- Keep `VECTOR_STORECONTEXTS_DEDUP=on`.
- Keep `SEC_FILING_RAG_MAX_PER_RUN=1` until a paid-key/full-corpus plan is explicit.
- Keep `RAG_PINECONE_WRITE_BUDGET_ENABLED=on`.
- Start with `RAG_PINECONE_MAX_WRITE_UNITS_PER_DAY=50000` or lower on a fresh Starter account.
- Leave `WEB_SOURCE_SEC8K_FULL_BODY=off` and `RAG_EMBED_DISCLOSURES=off` until the admin RAG pages show
  clean health, sane write volume, and correct coverage.
