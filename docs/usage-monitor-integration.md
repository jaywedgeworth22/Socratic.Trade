# API Usage Monitor integration (Workstream C2)

How Agentic Trading (App B) reports real usage/cost to the **API Usage Monitor**
(`usage.jays.services`) and consumes a budget signal back. Companion to the audit
in `docs/reviews/2026-06-30-improvement-audit.md` (§6.9) and the work-split in
`docs/reviews/2026-07-01-audit-work-split.md` (Cross-repo C2).

## Why

The monitor's poll adapters are structurally **blind** to this app's biggest cost
drivers: Anthropic (billing behind the Console) and Voyage (no usage API). App B
already computes real per-call LLM/RAG cost locally (`recordLlmUsage`,
`recordRagUsage`) and knows paid market-data call volume. This wires that data
out and adds a cost-aware feedback loop back in.

## Self-sufficiency (the hard rule)

**App B must run fully standalone if the monitor is down or unconfigured.** The
integration is:

- **Default OFF.** Nothing is pushed and nothing is read unless BOTH
  `USAGE_MONITOR_BASE_URL` and `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN` are set.
- **Fire-and-forget + never-throws.** The push is queued/debounced and its errors
  are swallowed; `recordLlmUsage` / `recordRagUsage` keep their "never break the
  caller" contract.
- **Fail-open.** The cost-aware loop treats an unreachable/erroring monitor as
  "budget unknown" and does **not** enforce — a monitor outage never blocks a run.
- **Observable, not intrusive.** The only visible effect of a monitor outage is a
  `usage-monitor` row on the admin connections-health page (via `logApiHealth`).

## Configuration (App B env)

| Var | Default | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `USAGE_MONITOR_BASE_URL` | _(blank)_ | Monitor base URL. Blank → push + budget read disabled. |
| `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN` | _(blank)_ | Bearer token for `POST /api/ingest/usage` (the monitor's `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN`). Also used for the budget read unless the monitor sets a separate `USAGE_READ_TOKEN`. Blank → disabled. |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_ENV` | `NODE_ENV` | `environment` label stamped on pushed events (keeps preview vs prod spend separate). |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_FLUSH_MS` | `2000` | Debounce before a batched flush. |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_TIMEOUT_MS` | `8000` | Per-POST timeout. |
| `USAGE_BUDGET_ENFORCE` | `off` | Phase 2 enforcement. Off → over-budget only alerts (Phase 1). On → downgrade model / skip cycle. |
| `USAGE_BUDGET_TTL_MS` | `300000` | Budget-status cache TTL. |
| `USAGE_BUDGET_ALERT_COOLDOWN_MS` | `21600000` | Per-(user, provider, level) alert cooldown. |

### What gets pushed

- **LLM** (`recordLlmUsage`): `provider` (openai/anthropic/xai/gemini/mistral/deepseek),
  `service:"llm"`, `label:<context>`, `keyRef`, `unit:"token"`, `quantity:<total
  tokens>`, `costUsd` (from `estimateLlmCostUsd`), `metricType:"cost"|"usage"`,
  `metadata:{model,context,userId,keySource,prompt/completion tokens}`.
- **RAG** (`recordRagUsage`): `provider` (voyage/pinecone), `service:"rag"`,
  `label:<operation>`, `unit:"token"`, `costUsd` (from `estimateRagCost`). This is the
  **single cost authority** for Voyage/Pinecone spend.
- **Provider dispatch** (`withDurableRagProviderDispatch` in `vector-db.ts`, `requestFmp` in
  `fmp-common.ts`): `service:"provider-dispatch"`, `label:<operation>`, `unit:"request"`. This
  lane is **quota/reservation-only externally** — the event actually pushed to the monitor
  (`createProviderDispatchUsageMonitorEvent` in `usage-monitor-push.ts`) always carries
  `metricType:"usage"` with no `costUsd`, for every provider, unconditionally — it exists purely to
  report request volume against the durable per-credential rate window, never a dollar figure.
  Cost for these providers is owned exclusively by their dedicated ledger lane (the RAG bullet
  above for Voyage; FMP has none, it's poll-primary).
  This is deliberately two-layered: Voyage embed/rerank call sites in `vector-db.ts` pass a real
  `estimateVoyageDispatchCost(...)` estimate into the *local* reservation
  (`reserveProviderDispatch`, `provider_dispatch_attempts.estimated_cost_usd`), because that number
  still drives the LOCAL per-credential daily cost-cap fuse (`PROVIDER_DISPATCH_VOYAGE_*_MAX_COST_USD_PER_DAY`,
  default $25/day) — zeroing it there would silently disable that fuse. `createProviderDispatchUsageMonitorEvent`
  is the single choke point for every provider-dispatch event sent to the monitor (both the
  immediate push on startup and the crash-durable replay/reconciliation pass run through it), and
  it discards `estimatedCostUsd`/`actualCostUsd` before building the outbound event — so the same
  real local estimate never reaches the wire. FMP's local estimate is already 0 (poll-primary, no
  local fuse needed), so it was and remains unaffected by this zeroing.
  A 2026-07-15 version of this fix briefly zeroed the Voyage dispatch calls' *local* estimate
  instead of the push boundary, which fixed the double-count but silently disabled the local Voyage
  cost-cap fuse — corrected the same day: the local estimate is real again, and the push-boundary
  zero in `usage-monitor-push.ts` is what actually prevents the receiver (which aggregates
  `ExternalUsageEvent.costUsd` by provider name, ignoring `service`) from double-counting the same
  spend the RAG ledger lane already reported.
- **Call-volume** (paid API providers): aggregated per provider per flush window as
  a single `metricType:"usage"`, `unit:"request"`, `requests:<count>` event —
  never one POST per call. Market-data providers use their `fetchWithRetry` service
  label. Broker-bundled activity is deliberately excluded: Alpaca (including
  `alpaca-news`/`alpaca-snapshot`), Robinhood, and Tradier have no separate monitored
  subscription or meaningful quota/cost record in this app.

Every delivery now carries a fixed-length explicit idempotency key: SHA-256 over
the event kind plus its source identity. LLM and RAG source identities and
`occurredAt` values come from the same durable local ledger row; each call-volume
lane gets a UUID when its aggregate window opens. A failed or ambiguous POST is kept in
memory and retried with the exact original payload (including key and timestamp),
using bounded exponential backoff. This preserves transport retry deduplication
and prevents distinct lanes in one flush from colliding just because they share
`provider`, `metricType`, and `occurredAt`. The shared five-field fallback remains
unchanged for other producers.

Discrete LLM/RAG delivery is also crash-durable. `usage-monitor-replay.ts` reads the persisted
ledgers in `(created_at,id)` order, reconstructs the exact event key/timestamp, and advances a
per-ledger watermark in the existing internal `settings` table only after the batch is acknowledged.
Every pass inclusively re-sends the last acknowledged row once; receiver idempotency makes that
overlap safe if the app dies between remote acknowledgement and its local watermark write. The
watermark update is monotonic inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, so an overlapping deploy cannot regress it.
The worker runs immediately at Node startup and every minute, bounded to ten 100-event pages per
ledger per pass. It needs no schema migration or additional env variable.

Every newly emitted event carries top-level `project:"socratic-trade"`. The raw `provider`
value remains unchanged at the producer; canonical provider/project resolution belongs to the
monitor receiver.

The producer exact-pins immutable shared release `v2.0.0` and sends only the strict v2 envelope:
`schemaVersion:2`, batch-level `producerId:"socratic-trade"`, and event-level `eventId` plus
`producerKeyRef`. Deprecated v1 `sourceApp`, `idempotencyKey`, and `keyRef` fields never appear on
the wire. An in-memory one-time normalizer preserves buffered pre-v2 events across hot reloads; the
durable LLM/RAG/provider ledgers reconstruct fresh strict-v2 events from their source rows.

### Push-primary providers (item 3)

No monitor code change is needed for Anthropic/Voyage to become
"push-primary": items 1–2 simply set `provider` correctly so those events land in
`ExternalUsageEvent`. The monitor keeps its poll adapters for providers where
polling works (openai, finnhub, …). The budget endpoint below combines
both channels.

## Budget status (monitor)

`GET /api/budget-status` (token-gated: `USAGE_READ_TOKEN` if set, else
`USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN`) returns, per active provider, month-to-date spend vs
`ProviderPlan.monthlyBudgetUsd`. Spend combines both channels **without
double-counting**:

```
spentUsd = fixedMonthlyCostUsd
         + max(latestSnapshot.totalCost, pushedMeteredMonthToDateUsd)
         + materializedSubscriptionMonthToDateUsd
```

`max()` is deliberate: push-primary providers have no poll snapshot (so
`pushedMonthToDate` dominates), while poll-primary providers keep their snapshot
cost even if App B also pushes some events for them. Budget alerts reuse
`buildProviderAlertState` from `provider-alerts.ts`. Per-provider `status` is
`ok | warning (≥80%) | exceeded (≥100%) | unconfigured (no budget)`.

## Cost-aware feedback loop (item 4)

- **Phase 1 — alerts (on whenever the monitor is configured).** At each scheduled
  run entry, `checkBudgetAndAlert` fires a `budget_alert` notification (through the
  existing `sendNotification` pipe) for any provider at `warning`/`exceeded`,
  throttled per (user, provider, level).
- **Phase 1.5 — advisory (on whenever the monitor is configured, independent of the
  enforce flag) — wired 2026-07-05.** Every run reads budget status once and:
  - stamps a `usage_budget_status` audit receipt with the raw per-provider
    spend/status plus a **preview** of what enforcement would do
    (`previewBudgetDecision` — same decision logic as Phase 2 below, but ungated
    on `USAGE_BUDGET_ENFORCE`, so the owner can see the counterfactual before
    opting in);
  - injects a compact `formatBudgetAdvisory()` line into the Bull `userContent`
    next to `drawdownAdvisory` whenever a provider is at `warning`/`exceeded` —
    explicitly framed as data for the agent ("YOU decide..."), never a command.
- **Phase 2 — enforcement (default-off, `USAGE_BUDGET_ENFORCE`) — wired
  2026-07-05** into `runStrategyOnce` at the existing per-user/day LLM budget
  choke point (after the drawdown breaker + volatility brake, before any LLM
  call). `evaluateBudgetForRun` + `cheaperModel` (given the effective served
  model — resolving `policy.llmModel` through the same default as
  `resolveLlmEndpoint`) downgrade the LLM/red model to a cheaper tier, or skip
  the LLM step when the green model is already cheapest. The safety
  requirements from the original deferral (2026-07-01 Codex PR review) hold:
  - the cycle-skip skips **only the LLM proposal step** — the run still
    completes; broker reconciliation (`reconcilePendingFills`/
    `flagStalePlacingIntents`) and the risk-reducing exits (drawdown breaker,
    volatility brake, protective stops) already ran before this choke point;
  - the downgrade applies to the run's **in-memory** `RunnablePolicy` object
    only, never the object `setPolicy` may persist on a breaker trip — a
    temporary downgrade never becomes permanent;
  - the override is threaded into `debateProposal` via its optional 5th
    `policyOverride` parameter (added alongside this wiring) — the caller in
    `strategy.ts` passes the same in-memory `policy` object explicitly instead
    of letting `debateProposal` re-read `getPolicy(userId)` from the DB, so the
    Bear review picks up the downgraded `redTeamLlmModel` too.

  See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-05-usage-budget-advisory-wiring.md` for the full
  change (including the new `test/usage-budget-strategy-integration.test.ts`
  e2e coverage of advisory-only / enforced-downgrade / enforced-skip /
  evaluator-failure-fail-open).

## Shared client and idempotency contract

`src/lib/usage-monitor-push.ts` uses `createUsageTelemetryClient` from
`@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared`. Every strict-v2 event has an explicit `eventId`;
the receiver deduplicates on `(producerId,eventId)` and rejects conflicting replays. This producer
derives IDs from durable source rows or one allocated aggregate-window ID, then hashes them before
transmission so identity remains stable and below the ingest length cap. Provider credential
identity is transmitted separately as `producerKeyRef` and never participates in replay identity.

## Operator setup notes

- For a push-primary provider (Anthropic, Voyage) to appear in
  `/api/budget-status` with a real budget, the monitor must have a **Provider row**
  named to match the pushed `provider` string (case-insensitive) **with a
  `monthlyBudgetUsd`** set. Pushed events for a provider that has no Provider row
  still land in `ExternalUsageEvent` (and show in the dashboard's "External App
  Telemetry" section) but contribute no budget number and drive no enforcement —
  there's nothing to compare against. This is expected: enforcement needs a budget.

## Known follow-ups (from the 2026-07-01 adversarial review)

- **Dashboard parity (being addressed on API Usage Monitor branch
  `codex-app-wide-hardening`):** `/api/providers` + `/api/providers/[id]` compute alerts from
  the poll snapshot only, so a push-primary provider shows budget alerts in
  `/api/budget-status` but not on its dashboard card. Merging month-to-date
  `ExternalUsageEvent` cost into those endpoints (as `/api/budget-status` already
  does) aligns them; do not treat this as production-live until that monitor PR is merged and
  its Render revision is verified.
- **Orphaned pushed providers:** a pushed `provider` string with no matching Provider
  row is silently excluded from budget math (fails safe to 0). Consider surfacing
  unmatched providers for operator visibility.

## Verification

- **App B:** `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`, `npm run build`.
  New tests: `test/usage-monitor-push.test.ts`, `test/usage-monitor-replay.test.ts`,
  `test/usage-budget.test.ts`.
- **Monitor:** `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`), `npm run build`.
