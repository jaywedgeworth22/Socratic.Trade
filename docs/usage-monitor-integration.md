# API Usage Monitor integration (Workstream C2)

How Agentic Trading (App B) reports real usage/cost to the **API Usage Monitor**
(`usage.jays.services`) and consumes a budget signal back. Companion to the audit
in `docs/reviews/2026-06-30-improvement-audit.md` (§6.9) and the work-split in
`docs/reviews/2026-07-01-audit-work-split.md` (Cross-repo C2).

## Why

The monitor's poll adapters are structurally **blind** to this app's biggest cost
drivers: Anthropic (billing behind the Console), Voyage (no usage API), and
Robinhood (no public retail API). App B already computes real per-call LLM/RAG
cost locally (`recordLlmUsage`, `recordRagUsage`) and knows its market-data /
broker call volume — but none of it left the box. This wires that data out, and
adds a cost-aware feedback loop back in.

## Self-sufficiency (the hard rule)

**App B must run fully standalone if the monitor is down or unconfigured.** The
integration is:

- **Default OFF.** Nothing is pushed and nothing is read unless BOTH
  `USAGE_MONITOR_BASE_URL` and `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN` are set.
- **Fire-and-forget + never-throws.** The push is queued/debounced and its errors
  are swallowed; `recordLlmUsage` / `recordRagUsage` keep their "never break the
  caller" contract.
- **Fail-open.** The cost-aware loop treats an unreachable/erroring monitor as
  "budget unknown" and does **not** enforce — a monitor outage never blocks a run.
- **Observable, not intrusive.** The only visible effect of a monitor outage is a
  `usage-monitor` row on the admin connections-health page (via `logApiHealth`).

## Configuration (App B env)

| Var | Default | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `USAGE_MONITOR_BASE_URL` | _(blank)_ | Monitor base URL. Blank → push + budget read disabled. |
| `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN` | _(blank)_ | Bearer token for `POST /api/ingest/usage` (the monitor's `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN`). Also used for the budget read unless the monitor sets a separate `USAGE_READ_TOKEN`. Blank → disabled. |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_ENV` | `NODE_ENV` | `environment` label stamped on pushed events (keeps preview vs prod spend separate). |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_FLUSH_MS` | `2000` | Debounce before a batched flush. |
| `USAGE_MONITOR_TIMEOUT_MS` | `8000` | Per-POST timeout. |
| `USAGE_BUDGET_ENFORCE` | `off` | Phase 2 enforcement. Off → over-budget only alerts (Phase 1). On → downgrade model / skip cycle. |
| `USAGE_BUDGET_TTL_MS` | `300000` | Budget-status cache TTL. |
| `USAGE_BUDGET_ALERT_COOLDOWN_MS` | `21600000` | Per-(user, provider, level) alert cooldown. |

## Data flow

```
recordLlmUsage / recordRagUsage ─┐
fetchWithRetry (market-data)     ├─► usage-monitor-push.ts (queue + per-provider
alpaca.trackHealth / robinhood   ─┘   call-volume aggregate; debounced batch flush)
                                        │  POST /api/ingest/usage  (Bearer)
                                        ▼
                              API Usage Monitor → ExternalUsageEvent

runStrategyOnce entry ──► usage-budget.ts ──GET /api/budget-status──► monitor
   (Phase 1) over-budget → notify(budget_alert)
   (Phase 1.5, always on) → audit(usage_budget_status) + Bull prompt advisory line
   (Phase 2, USAGE_BUDGET_ENFORCE) → downgrade model / skip cycle (+ audit(usage_budget_enforced))
```

### What gets pushed

- **LLM** (`recordLlmUsage`): `provider` (openai/anthropic/xai/gemini/mistral/deepseek),
  `service:"llm"`, `label:<context>`, `keyRef`, `unit:"token"`, `quantity:<total
  tokens>`, `costUsd` (from `estimateLlmCostUsd`), `metricType:"cost"|"usage"`,
  `metadata:{model,context,userId,keySource,prompt/completion tokens}`.
- **RAG** (`recordRagUsage`): `provider` (voyage/pinecone), `service:"rag"`,
  `label:<operation>`, `unit:"token"`, `costUsd` (from `estimateRagCost`).
- **Call-volume** (market-data + broker): aggregated per provider per flush window as
  a single `metricType:"usage"`, `unit:"request"`, `requests:<count>` event —
  never one POST per call. Brokers are tagged `provider:"alpaca"|"robinhood"`,
  `service:"broker"`; market-data providers use their `fetchWithRetry` service label
  (finnhub, fmp, yahoo-finance, tradier, …).

Every delivery now carries a fixed-length explicit idempotency key: SHA-256 over
the event kind plus its source identity. LLM and RAG source identities and
`occurredAt` values come from the same durable local ledger row; broker balance
metrics share one snapshot identity with metric suffixes; each call-volume lane
gets a UUID when its aggregate window opens. A failed or ambiguous POST is kept in
memory and retried with the exact original payload (including key and timestamp),
using bounded exponential backoff. This preserves transport retry deduplication
and prevents distinct lanes in one flush from colliding just because they share
`provider`, `metricType`, and `occurredAt`. The shared five-field fallback remains
unchanged for other producers.

The event shape mirrors `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared`'s
`UsageTelemetryEventSchema` and the monitor's server parser
(`src/lib/usage-telemetry.ts`).

### Push-primary providers (item 3)

No monitor code change is needed for Anthropic/Voyage/Robinhood to become
"push-primary": items 1–2 simply set `provider` correctly so those events land in
`ExternalUsageEvent`. The monitor keeps its poll adapters for providers where
polling works (openai, alpaca, finnhub, …). The budget endpoint below combines
both channels.

## Budget status (monitor)

`GET /api/budget-status` (token-gated: `USAGE_READ_TOKEN` if set, else
`USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN`) returns, per active provider, month-to-date spend vs
`ProviderPlan.monthlyBudgetUsd`. Spend combines both channels **without
double-counting**:

```
spentUsd = fixedMonthlyCostUsd
         + max(latestSnapshot.totalCost, pushedMeteredMonthToDateUsd)
         + materializedSubscriptionMonthToDateUsd
```

`max()` is deliberate: push-primary providers have no poll snapshot (so
`pushedMonthToDate` dominates), while poll-primary providers keep their snapshot
cost even if App B also pushes some events for them. Budget alerts reuse
`buildProviderAlertState` from `provider-alerts.ts`. Per-provider `status` is
`ok | warning (≥80%) | exceeded (≥100%) | unconfigured (no budget)`.

## Cost-aware feedback loop (item 4)

- **Phase 1 — alerts (on whenever the monitor is configured).** At each scheduled
  run entry, `checkBudgetAndAlert` fires a `budget_alert` notification (through the
  existing `sendNotification` pipe) for any provider at `warning`/`exceeded`,
  throttled per (user, provider, level).
- **Phase 1.5 — advisory (on whenever the monitor is configured, independent of the
  enforce flag) — wired 2026-07-05.** Every run reads budget status once and:
  - stamps a `usage_budget_status` audit receipt with the raw per-provider
    spend/status plus a **preview** of what enforcement would do
    (`previewBudgetDecision` — same decision logic as Phase 2 below, but ungated
    on `USAGE_BUDGET_ENFORCE`, so the owner can see the counterfactual before
    opting in);
  - injects a compact `formatBudgetAdvisory()` line into the Bull `userContent`
    next to `drawdownAdvisory` whenever a provider is at `warning`/`exceeded` —
    explicitly framed as data for the agent ("YOU decide..."), never a command.
- **Phase 2 — enforcement (default-off, `USAGE_BUDGET_ENFORCE`) — wired
  2026-07-05** into `runStrategyOnce` at the existing per-user/day LLM budget
  choke point (after the drawdown breaker + volatility brake, before any LLM
  call). `evaluateBudgetForRun` + `cheaperModel` (given the effective served
  model — resolving `policy.llmModel` through the same default as
  `resolveLlmEndpoint`) downgrade the LLM/red model to a cheaper tier, or skip
  the LLM step when the green model is already cheapest. The safety
  requirements from the original deferral (2026-07-01 Codex PR review) hold:
  - the cycle-skip skips **only the LLM proposal step** — the run still
    completes; broker reconciliation (`reconcilePendingFills`/
    `flagStalePlacingIntents`) and the risk-reducing exits (drawdown breaker,
    volatility brake, protective stops) already ran before this choke point;
  - the downgrade applies to the run's **in-memory** `RunnablePolicy` object
    only, never the object `setPolicy` may persist on a breaker trip — a
    temporary downgrade never becomes permanent;
  - the override is threaded into `debateProposal` via its optional 5th
    `policyOverride` parameter (added alongside this wiring) — the caller in
    `strategy.ts` passes the same in-memory `policy` object explicitly instead
    of letting `debateProposal` re-read `getPolicy(userId)` from the DB, so the
    Bear review picks up the downgraded `redTeamLlmModel` too.

  See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-05-usage-budget-advisory-wiring.md` for the full
  change (including the new `test/usage-budget-strategy-integration.test.ts`
  e2e coverage of advisory-only / enforced-downgrade / enforced-skip /
  evaluator-failure-fail-open).

## Shared client and idempotency contract

`src/lib/usage-monitor-push.ts` uses `createUsageTelemetryClient` from
`@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared`. The monitor persists explicit keys and
deduplicates identical retries. Its deterministic five-field fallback is retained
for producers that omit a key, but lane/detail fields are deliberately outside
that compatibility basis. This producer therefore supplies explicit source IDs
where it has stronger event identity instead of changing the shared algorithm.
Source IDs are hashed before transmission, which keeps keys below the ingest
length cap even if an upstream identifier is unexpectedly large.

## Operator setup notes

- For a push-primary provider (Anthropic, Voyage, Robinhood) to appear in
  `/api/budget-status` with a real budget, the monitor must have a **Provider row**
  named to match the pushed `provider` string (case-insensitive) **with a
  `monthlyBudgetUsd`** set. Pushed events for a provider that has no Provider row
  still land in `ExternalUsageEvent` (and show in the dashboard's "External App
  Telemetry" section) but contribute no budget number and drive no enforcement —
  there's nothing to compare against. This is expected: enforcement needs a budget.

## Known follow-ups (from the 2026-07-01 adversarial review)

- **Dashboard parity (being addressed on API Usage Monitor branch
  `codex-app-wide-hardening`):** `/api/providers` + `/api/providers/[id]` compute alerts from
  the poll snapshot only, so a push-primary provider shows budget alerts in
  `/api/budget-status` but not on its dashboard card. Merging month-to-date
  `ExternalUsageEvent` cost into those endpoints (as `/api/budget-status` already
  does) aligns them; do not treat this as production-live until that monitor PR is merged and
  its Render revision is verified.
- **Orphaned pushed providers:** a pushed `provider` string with no matching Provider
  row is silently excluded from budget math (fails safe to 0). Consider surfacing
  unmatched providers for operator visibility.

## Verification

- **App B:** `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`, `npm run build`.
  New tests: `test/usage-monitor-push.test.ts`, `test/usage-budget.test.ts`.
- **Monitor:** `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`), `npm run build`.
