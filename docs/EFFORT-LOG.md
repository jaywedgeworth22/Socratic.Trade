# Trading Effort Log - canonical live cross-agent board

This is the branch-neutral live coordination board for Socratic Trade work across
Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity/Gemini, Cursor, web/cloud sessions, and manual
operator edits.

Canonical location:

`/Users/jay/apps/TRADING-EFFORT-LOG.md`

Tracked mirror in the repo:

`docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`

Rules:
- Every non-trivial effort must be logged here as Planned before substantial work begins.
- Move active work to In Progress before substantial edits.
- Move to Completed only after merge to `main`.
- Move to Deployed only after production at `socratictrade.com` is actually released and verified.
- Never delete another agent's row. Correct in place and note the correction.
- **Never assign an effort to an agent unless that agent is actively working on it.**
  An agent tag (CLAUDE/CODEX/AG/MONET/CURSOR) on a row means that agent CURRENTLY OWNS
  the work and is actively building it. Do not pre-assign the backlog — unassigned rows
  are claimed by the first agent that starts them. If an agent stops working on an effort,
  remove the tag (or move it back to unassigned). Assignment is a live claim, not a
  reservation.
- When committing, also update the repo-tracked mirror at `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`.

State definitions:
- Planned: agreed or reserved, not started. Agent tags on Planned rows are only valid if
  that agent has actually claimed the work and plans to start it imminently. Otherwise
  leave the row unassigned (no agent tag) — first agent to pick it up claims it.
- In Progress: actively being built; include owner/worktree/branch and one-line status.
- Completed: merged to `main`; beta/integration only unless separately deployed.

_(Correction 2026-07-08, MONET: lines 17/25 above had "In Progress" wrongly replaced by
"Completed" — apparently a global find-replace slip; restored to match the repo mirror's
rules text. No effort rows were changed.)_
- Deployed: released to production (`socratictrade.com`) and verified.

As of 2026-07-08 (assignment-rule update).

## Deployed
- **PROD RELEASE 2026-07-09 (MONET, roth-gemini/runonce session): Coolify deploy gy3sbqag
  FINISHED + health-verified — production = `main@f9a37611` exactly (container healthy,
  /api/health ok, scheduler ticking; disk held 9.6G free).** Shipped PR #1190 (Roth IRA
  Gemini-400 TRUE root cause = maxItems x schema-complexity overflow -> toGeminiJsonSchema
  strips maxItems; async Run-once = 8s window then 202 started; console HTML-error shield vs
  raw CF 524) + #1191 single-adversary consolidation (rode along; that lane's payload). Deploy
  RECOVERY note: first attempt (p11b55w1) WEDGED at 100% disk (67MB free) — reclaimed ~14G of
  unused Docker images + build cache (volumes/running-app untouched; documented 4GB-box
  hazard), cancelled the stall, re-triggered clean. Gemini fix confirmed present in the running
  image; Robinhood sub-$1 min-guard fired once in prod (my alert-triage fix working). Roth's
  live proof pends the 13:30Z regular open (Roth runDuringExtendedHours=false — correctly gated,
  NOT a bug); 08:41 CDT auto-confirm scheduled. Rollout:
  docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-roth-gemini-400-runonce-async.md.
- **PROD RELEASE 2026-07-09 (FIRST announce-then-deploy run, MONET ui-sweep session):
  Coolify deploy FINISHED + health-verified — `/api/health` ok:true, db ok, scheduler
  ticking (15s age); production = `main` HEAD as of trigger (>= `f849c342`).** Shipped the
  undeployed batch: CODEX #1181 (Home evidence SymbolButton drawer parity) + #1184
  (guardrails tooltip titles) + docs close-outs #1183/#1185/#1186 (+ docs-only #1188
  AGENTS.md ANNOUNCE-THEN-DEPLOY reconcile if it merged in-window). First release under the
  2026-07-09 owner ruling: single claim line + 10-min no-objection window + deployer owns
  verify/boards — no double-trigger (contrast the 8bc0967f release below). Disk-cleanup lane
  ran in parallel; build did not wedge.
- **PROD RELEASE 2026-07-09 (owner-directed in-session, MONET prod-release): Coolify
  deploy `krk1db6x` FINISHED + verified — production = `main@8bc0967f` EXACTLY.**
  Ships Codex PR #1175 (Red Team efficacy Results card) and PR #1174 (LIVE bulk
  typed-confirm approval flow) on top of prior production `6a59a7eb`. Verified by
  MONET via Coolify/container health plus `/api/health` ok and scheduler ticking; Codex
  independently checked `/api/health` 200 during the deploy watch.
- **Wire the getRedTeamEfficacy scorecard into the console (CODEX, M) — DEPLOYED
  2026-07-09 via PR #1175 (`9cc99963`) and Coolify deploy `krk1db6x`
  (`main@8bc0967f`).** Results now surfaces veto-efficacy snapshot data, sample
  gating, override splits, and `unattributed` reviewer history in production.
- **Batch typed-confirm flow for LIVE proposals in approvals triage (CODEX, M) —
  DEPLOYED 2026-07-09 via PR #1174 (`8bc0967f`) and Coolify deploy `krk1db6x`
  (`main@8bc0967f`).** LIVE bulk approve now uses the server-side batch route,
  server-derived live membership, 20-row cap, row-honest partial outcomes, and one
  aggregate typed phrase when the owner setting requires it.
- **PROD RELEASE 2026-07-08 (owner-directed in-session, MONET intro-anim session): Coolify
  deploy `nitgo442` FINISHED + verified — production = `main@6a59a7eb` EXACTLY.** Ships #1170
  (intro landing fixes) + #1171 (shared-dep cleanup) + #1173 (mobile chrome bar) + #873
  (motion bump) + #1178 (mobile nav/drawer wave). Verified: deployment-record commit
  6a59a7eb, app running:healthy, edge 307->/login 200, /api/health ok:true scheduler
  ticking. All merged work is in production as of this stanza. (Lane owners: flip your own
  Completed rows for #1178/#1171 to Deployed.)
- **Intro->logo handoff polish + mobile brand row (MONET) — DEPLOYED 2026-07-08 (merged as
  PR #1112 = `7209f0f3`; in production via the SSE-fix Coolify RESTART `y8ie6lgx`, whose
  deployment record shows commit 7209f0f3 exactly — a Coolify "restart" on this git-sourced
  app REBUILDS from main, i.e. it is a deploy, not an env-only bounce; prod-lane take note).** Owner: (1) the persistent
  header logo must stay invisible until the intro candles assemble it (today it's visible
  from first paint and the candles fly onto it); (2) on mobile (<lg, where the bar logo is
  display:none and the intro lands on a phantom box) show a big full-width "SOCRATIC TRADE"
  row ABOVE the controls bar (~2x-tall chrome) as the landing target, hold ~3s after
  landing, then slide up/away to reclaim space. New `app/console/ui/intro-bus.ts` phase
  channel; edits `intro-canvas.tsx` (phase writes + first-VISIBLE [data-brand-logo]
  measurement), `shell.tsx` (BrandReveal + MobileBrandRow). No overlap with ui-audit-sweep
  or activity-lane filesets (announced).
- **PROD RELEASE 2026-07-08 (owner-directed in-session, MONET intro-anim session): Coolify
  deploy `rjskkyzx` of `socratic-trade-prod` FINISHED + verified — production now runs
  `main@4af98aaa` EXACTLY.** Ships #1095 (inline-Bear bare-array recovery — closes the
  silent-full-veto gap #1091 missed) + #1097 (sweep docs close-out). Verified: deployment
  record commit = 4af98aaa, app running:healthy, https://socratictrade.com 307->/login 200.
  As of this release EVERY effort marked Completed on this board is in production —
  Completed rows below this line that predate this stanza no longer imply "not yet
  deployed." (Prev deploy n1v296 = ea779bbf, earlier today.)
- **PR #1095 inline-Bear bare-array recovery + #1097 docs close-out (MONET,
  single-adversary-addendum session) — DEPLOYED 2026-07-08 via deploy `rjskkyzx`.** New
  exported `parseBearSurvivors` (strategy.ts): proposal-shaped bare arrays recovered;
  explicit `{proposals:[]}` stays a real veto; all malformed -> fallbackToBull, never a
  silent full veto. 7 tests. _(Row added at release close-out by the intro-anim MONET
  session — the fixing session announced on #agent-sync but hadn't boarded it here.)_
- **Intro animation: skip centered-wordmark middle act (MONET) — DEPLOYED 2026-07-08.**
  Merged as PR #1089 (merge commit ea779bbf); shipped to socratictrade.com in prod deploy
  n1v296 (deployed commit = ea779bbf exactly, health-verified per sync-4). Candles fly
  chart -> top-left header logo directly (~6.1s, was ~9.3s); centered SOCRATIC / TRADE act
  preserved behind `CENTER_WORDMARK_STEP: boolean = false` in
  `app/console/components/intro-canvas.tsx` (flip to true to restore). Rollout note
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-08-intro-skip-center-wordmark.md`.

- **ALL preview servers retired (OWNER decision via MONET) - DONE 2026-07-08 ~00:50 CDT.** Owner: never used them, some behind CF Access agents cannot pass. End state = production only. Coolify preview app DELETED, preview DNS incl. *.jays.services wildcard DELETED, Mac PM2 previews (trading-main/claude/codex) STOPPED, Mac trading+litestream pm2 apps DELETED (accidental double-starts x2 tonight; rollback = pm2 start ~/apps/trading.config.cjs). Coolify PR-previews considered + NOT enabled (4GB box). AGENTS.md carries the definitive do-not-recreate stanza. Rollout: docs/rollouts/2026-07-08-previews-retired.md. NOTE: CLAUDE PR #1038 (integration-only teardown docs) is superseded - needs update/close.
- 2026-07-08 00:19 CDT - **Post-cutover incident RESOLVED: double-run of Mac prod (MONET).** A parallel MONET session ran the deprecated `trading-publish.sh` ~1h after cutover -> Mac pm2 `trading` restarted -> ~5min double-scheduler vs the box. Re-stopped 05:19Z; damage scan clean (0 proposals/fills; 9x MU synthetic-stop 422 client_order_id-unique rejections = deterministic-id dedupe held; litestream untouched; markets closed). Hardening: `trading-publish.sh` now refuses to run without `FORCE_MAC_PROD_ROLLBACK=1`. Fleet corrected on #agent-sync; owner push-notified. NOTE for the parallel session's rows below/above: its "Prod re-deployed clean @ 2d113054" claim refers to the RETIRED Mac lane — actual production (Coolify) still runs main-tip from cutover; trigger a Coolify deploy to ship 2d113054.
- 2026-07-07 ~23:15 CDT - **PRODUCTION socratictrade.com MIGRATED to the Coolify box (MONET, owner-directed) — DEPLOYED + VERIFIED.** `socratictrade.com` now = Coolify app `socratic-trade-prod` (uuid `m1os7ijf31bg3fanil152e4b`, main @ `e73c66a4`+#1039, nixpacks, auto-deploy OFF) on `91.98.44.8`; Mac pm2 `trading`+`litestream` STOPPED (saved stopped = rollback standby; do NOT restart while box runs `DB_BOOTSTRAP=live` — double-scheduler). DB moved via litestream 0.5.14 restore from the R2 replica; litestream now replicates in-container to the same path (PITR continuity). Secrets stay in Infisical (in-container CLI, `REQUIRE_SECRETS_MANAGER` enforced). Verified: edge 200/307, `/api/health` ok + scheduler ticking, restored-DB markers (provider-tier cache from 07-07, autoResumeOnBoot resumed), container stable. **Release process changed: prod deploy = trigger Coolify deploy of `socratic-trade-prod`; `~/apps/trading-publish.sh` DEPRECATED.** Also fixed pre-existing `trading.jays.services` edge 503 (http:// FQDN vs CF SSL=full; https:// FQDN is the required scheme). PR #1039 (boot script + litestream config) + docs PR. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-07-prod-coolify-migration.md`.
- 2026-07-07 - `trading-live` published at `790b5f52` on `socratictrade.com` (MONET, owner-directed, `~/apps/trading-publish.sh`). "Move everything on main into production": full `origin/main` HEAD `790b5f52` pinned into the live build (node@24, `npm ci` from lockfile, `next build`, `pm2 restart trading`). This carries the latest `main` including the MONET risk lanes not yet in the prior prod cut — #881 regime-severity, #883 vol-targeting + portfolio-heat, #945 fractional-Kelly, #879 correlation/blackout/stress (all advisory/owner-overridable, default-off) — plus everything else merged since `7b5450fe`. Verified: `/api/health` `ok:true` / `db: ok` / scheduler ticking (~9s age), live HEAD == `origin/main`, pm2 `trading` online with `unstable_restarts: 0` (the 2026-07-06 EALLOWSCRIPTS/better-sqlite3 crash-loop did NOT recur — only a benign `npm warn allow-scripts`).
- 2026-07-06 - `trading-live` published at `3910ede2` on `socratictrade.com` (AG, PR #1014). Refactored API client and stream parser to use `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared`. Removed duplicated logic from App A and pinned exact version match with App B.

- 2026-07-06 - `trading-live` published at `1c0c20d3` on `socratictrade.com` (CLAUDE, owner-run
  `~/apps/trading-publish.sh`, PR #998). Learned-context UX: reworded the awkward/over-scoped
  empty-state copy on the Learned Context approval queue, and shipped the "browse + delete what
  was silently learned" archive the design doc promised but never built — new
  `deleteLearnedContext` (ownership-scoped, also the shared-contribution erasure path),
  `GET /api/learned-context` + `DELETE /api/learned-context/[id]`, and a collapsed-by-default
  `LearnedFactsArchive` component. 8-angle adversarial review found no correctness/security bugs.
  Verify: 283 files / 2843 tests green, tsc clean, lint 0 errors, build clean (re-run post-merge —
  branch had drifted far behind main). Prod verified: `/api/health` 200, `pm2 trading` stable (0
  unstable restarts), new route live (401 unauthenticated, not 404/500). See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-learned-context-archive.md`.

- 2026-07-06 - `trading-live` published at `7b5450fe` on `socratictrade.com` (CLAUDE, owner-run
  `~/apps/trading-publish.sh`). Ships the full CLAUDE backlog train (#816 prompt-safety, #819
  usage-budget advisory, #820 due-jobs, #822 hyde-multiquery) plus everything merged to `main`
  since (incl. #875 Red-Team policy-aware routing). Verified: local `:4000` + public
  `socratictrade.com` `/api/health` 200, `db: ok`, scheduler ticking, pm2 `trading` online with
  `unstable_restarts: 0`, live HEAD == `origin/main`. **Incident recovered during this deploy
  (host-side, not code):** prod was 500 crash-looping on a missing `better-sqlite3` native binary
  because (1) `~/.npmrc` had a stray `allow-scripts=happy` line that npm 11 rejects as
  `EALLOWSCRIPTS`, aborting `npm ci` on the `congress-trading-shared` git dependency (and `npm ci`
  wipes `node_modules` first → full outage), and (2) `brew` had bumped the default `node` 24→26
  (npm 10→11) though the repo pins node 24 (`.nvmrc`). Fixes: emptied `~/.npmrc`
  (backup `~/.npmrc.bak-20260706-deploy`), `brew link node@24` as default, hardened
  `~/apps/trading-publish.sh` to force `node@24` on PATH so future brew drift can't rebreak deploys.
- 2026-07-04 - `trading-live` published docs-only PR #446 at `497d06c9` on
  `socratictrade.com`; production health 200; repo mirror now records Codex PR
  #442 and PR #444 as deployed. This is the current production HEAD and contains
  the prior deployed code commit `1e1a15bc`.
- 2026-07-04 - `trading-live` published at `1e1a15bc` (PR #444) on
  `socratictrade.com`; production health 200; tokenless public HTTPS
  `congress-trading-shared` dependency path is live in the deployed build.
- 2026-07-04 - `trading-live` contains `94669873` (PR #442); production health
  200; Codex console/UI swimlane is live, including approval provenance/citations,
  mobile LIVE phrase parity, Sheet focus trap, read-only decision trace, ticker
  drawer parity, and Strategy custom-model select parity. Verified Deploy
  workflow success, PM2 `trading` online, `/api/health` 200, and built
  route/page artifacts present under `.next/server/app`.
- 2026-07-04 - Documentation update: added durable naming notes to `AGENTS.md`,
  `/Users/jay/apps/README.md`, and `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` that
  `Socratic.Trade` is canonical and `Socratic.Trading` is a typo/mistake; also
  corrected the remaining stale `git -C ~/Code/Agentic\ Trading ...` worktree
  command in `/Users/jay/apps/README.md`.
- 2026-07-04 - Ops correction: renamed the main Code-folder worktree from the
  mistaken intermediate `/Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trading` to the intended
  `/Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade`, repaired Git linked-worktree metadata,
  recreated and saved PM2 `trading-main` from the corrected path, verified
  local 4001 and production health, and updated active coordination path
  references in `AGENTS.md` and `/Users/jay/apps/README.md`.
- 2026-07-04 - Ops cleanup: deleted the stray `robinhood-agentic` Pinecone
  index from the new Pinecone account; verified Infisical still exports
  `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=socratic-trade` and Pinecone now lists only
  `socratic-trade` with 95 vectors. Renamed the main Code-folder project
  worktree from `/Users/jay/Code/Agentic Trading` to
  `/Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade`, repaired Git linked-worktree metadata
  including nested `.claude/worktrees`, recreated `trading-main` from the new
  path via `scripts/infisical-run.mjs`, saved PM2, and verified local 4001
  health plus production `socratictrade.com` health. Updated the active
  coordination path references in `AGENTS.md` and `/Users/jay/apps/README.md`.
- 2026-07-04 - Ops mitigation: investigated stray `robinhood-agentic`
  Pinecone index in the new account. It contains 16 SEC 8-K vectors, not
  Robinhood trade/account data, and was consistent with a stale worktree using
  the old `robinhood-agentic` fallback while pointed at the new Pinecone key.
  Added Infisical prod `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=socratic-trade`, restarted
  `trading`, `trading-main`, and `trading-codex`, verified main/Codex preview
  envs are pinned, production health is 200, and Pinecone counts at the time
  were `robinhood-agentic=16`, `socratic-trade=95` before the later cleanup.
- 2026-07-04 - Ops rotation: `ADMIN_REINDEX_TOKEN` added to the
  Socratic.Trade Infisical prod app project (`socratic-trade`), production
  `trading` PM2 process restarted, and `/api/admin/reindex-10k` verified as
  gated: no identity -> 401, identity without token -> 403, identity plus token
  -> 200 against Pinecone index `socratic-trade` with 95 vectors. Token value
  was not committed or logged.
- 2026-07-04 - `trading-live` published at `d39e1193` (PR #353) on
  `socratictrade.com`; production health 200; explicit local mock Test Account
  can be added without becoming the default account, and Pinecone/Voyage/provider
  cap trips now route through `budget_alert` with email-capable fallback.
- 2026-07-04 - `trading-live` published at `a017624a` (PR #354) on
  `socratictrade.com`; production health 200; new Pinecone `socratic-trade`
  index verified at 95 MSFT 10-Q vectors with matching local chunk ledger, and
  SEC filing ingest now uses deterministic vector ids for retry safety.
- 2026-07-03 - Ops rotation: Pinecone key replaced in Infisical prod and local
  preview env files (`trading-claude`, `trading-codex`, `trading-antigravity`);
  explicit RAG/Pinecone write fuses set in Infisical and preview envs; production,
  Codex, and Claude PM2 processes restarted; new Pinecone account has empty
  `socratic-trade` cosine/1024 serverless index (`vectors:0`). Key value was not
  committed or logged. `trading-main` PM2 env also refreshed through Infisical
  without touching tracked files in the dirty integration checkout.
- 2026-07-03 - `trading-live` published at `afbe1c87` (PR #352) on
  `socratictrade.com`; production health 200; RAG provider/quota failures now
  emit Sentry events when `SENTRY_DSN` is set, Pinecone-hosted NVIDIA/MSFT
  embeddings are documented as benchmark candidates, and Infisical current
  project naming is `Socratic.Trade` / `socratic-trade`. Fresh Pinecone key was
  not committed or logged.
- 2026-07-03 - `trading-live` published at `0941b4d2` (PR #349) on
  `socratictrade.com`; production health 200, Google/GitHub OAuth redirect URIs
  verified on the Socratic domain, and Codex preview synced back to main.
- 2026-07-03 - `trading-live` published at `481e9dcc` (PR #347) on
  `socratictrade.com`; production health 200 and S&P/Nasdaq mutual-exclusion UI
  behavior verified.
- 2026-07-03 - `trading-live` published at `7b803bff` (PR #346) on
  `socratictrade.com`; production health 200 and live Roth IRA Settings page verified.

## Completed
- **Quiver Quant API Integration & FMP Endpoint Expansion (AG, branch `agent/antigravity`) — COMPLETED 2026-07-12.** Integrated the Quiver Quant API into the backend application. Added Quiver Quant key support in `src/lib/db-api-keys.ts` and `app/api/keys/route.ts`. Created `QuiverQuantEnrichmentProvider` in `src/lib/data-providers.ts` and injected it into the main cascading enrichment workflow. Expanded the existing `FmpEnrichmentProvider` to utilize `/v3/key-metrics-ttm` and `/v3/financial-growth` endpoints. Updated `MarketQuote` and `SymbolEnrichment` structures in `src/lib/types.ts`. All test suites updated to reflect the new 6-endpoint FMP fetch count. Passed 3896 tests and clean build. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-12-quiver-quant-fmp.md`.
- **Web App Settings UI Refresh (AG, branch `agent/antigravity`) — COMPLETED 2026-07-12.** Replaced all settings page cards with iOS-style `ListSection` and `ListRow` components for a unified cross-platform aesthetic matching the native iOS app. Passed 349/3896 tests and clean build. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-12-ios-ui-refresh.md`.
- **App-wide Audit: Draining State and Cap Fixes (Antigravity/AG, branch `codex/app-wide-audit-20260711`) — COMPLETED 2026-07-12.** Fixed account-deletion race conditions by introducing a safe `is_draining` state and cascade cleanup (`purgeConnectedAccount`). Fixed daily notional risk tracking to accurately attribute to `placed_at` instead of `created_at`, covering `placing` intents as well. Updated various tests, SEC time-flakiness, and local dev forwarded-host behaviors. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-12-app-wide-audit-draining-fixes.md`.
- **LLM failover UI & account bursts (AG) — COMPLETED 2026-07-12.** Added jitter/stagger to concurrent account scheduling in `scheduler.ts` to mitigate shared OpenAI key bursts. Exposed `llmFallbackModels` in `app/console/strategy/page.tsx` via a text input and persistence logic.
- **Twilio A2P 10DLC compliance error handling (AG) — COMPLETED 2026-07-12.** Handled Twilio Error 30034 (A2P 10DLC unregistered) in `src/lib/notify.ts` to gracefully mark notification failures instead of crashing or retrying continuously.
- **Account-attribution sweep and P1 activity audit fixes (AG) — COMPLETED 2026-07-12.** Completed ~55-site sweep for `connectedAccountId` in audit calls across `strategy.ts`, `synthetic-stops.ts`, and `broker-protective-stops.ts`. Verified P1 fixes: Roth token cap raised to 4000+, thesis-tag coalescing added to post-mortem, and reflection signatures scoped per account.
- **Pre-proposal broker health/availability gate (AG, branch `agent/broker-health-gate`) — COMPLETED 2026-07-11.** Added a pre-proposal gate in `scheduler.ts` and `strategy.ts` that checks broker connectivity, recent `order_placement_uncertain` error rate (>=3 in 15m), and per-account minimum notional (>= $5) before generating proposals. Touches `execution-mode.ts` for health signals, `db-learning.ts` for fast audit counting, and `broker-health.ts` for the main check. All tests pass and build is green.
- **Admin server metrics provider-shape and degraded-response hardening (CODEX, PR #1400) — COMPLETED 2026-07-11.** Externally squash-merged to `main` as `432ca6fe` after local and hosted verify/smoke/security passed. Current Hetzner shapes are normalized, provider failures return explicit degraded receipts, fabricated fallback telemetry is removed, and malformed samples are omitted. Main auto-deploy was triggered; production revision remains independently unverified.
- **Retired Mac deploy workflow removal + active CI Sentry coverage (CODEX, PR #1398) — COMPLETED 2026-07-11.** Merged externally to `main` as `8fca436d` after hosted verify, smoke, security, and local Node24 gates passed. Removed the retired second-scheduler deploy workflow, synchronized independently runnable workflow/cron observability, and corrected reusable-only `workflow_call` handling. Main auto-deploy was triggered by the merge; production revision has not been independently verified, so this is not marked Deployed. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-11-retired-deploy-ci-observability.md`.
- **Retired Mac deploy workflow removal + active CI Sentry coverage (CODEX, PR #1398) — COMPLETED 2026-07-11.** Merged externally as `8fca436d` after hosted/local gates passed. Removed the retired second-scheduler deploy workflow and synchronized real GitHub workflow/cron observability. Main auto-deploy was triggered; production revision remains independently unverified. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-11-retired-deploy-ci-observability.md`.
- **Public auth/rate-limit hardening (CODEX, PR #1399) — COMPLETED 2026-07-11.** Merged externally as `97152c25`; trusted-IP OAuth limiting, bounded limiter state, explicit CF trust parsing, and paid tuning admission are on `main`. Main auto-deploy was triggered; production revision remains independently unverified.
- **Refactoring strategy.ts (AG, branch `agent/strategy-split`) — COMPLETED 2026-07-11.** Split the monolithic `strategy.ts` into `strategy-risk.ts` and `strategy-execution.ts`, retaining `strategy.ts` as a coordinator/barrel. Cleaned up dependencies and automated import fixes. All tests (3427) passing. Rollout note: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-11-strategy-split-refactoring.md`.
- **Reviewed-by-model proposal stamp (AG, branch `agent/antigravity-reviewed-by-model`) — ✅ COMPLETED 2026-07-09: PR #1282 merged to `main` (auto-merge squashed).** Resumed and verified the `reviewedByModel` proposal stamp task. Stamped `reviewedByModel` on trade proposals during the Red Team review loop, persisted it in closed lots, propagated it to the model stats API, and aggregated realized performance symmetrically for the Reviewer role. Gate green: tsc clean, lint 0 errors, 727 tests passed, Next.js build clean. PR opened via `land.sh`. See [2026-07-09-reviewed-by-model-proposal-stamp.md](file:///Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade/docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-reviewed-by-model-proposal-stamp.md).
- **Settings IA restructure - global-only Settings (CLAUDE, branch `claude/settings-global-only`) - COMPLETED 2026-07-10 (PR #1340 merged to main, squash dc633a1d).** /console/settings is global-only: Settings Models card DELETED (Framework /console/strategy is the single source of truth, incl. reasoning-effort controls; Coach picker survives on the Coach page); Tax treatment card MOVED to bottom of Framework (account-scoped, THIS ACCOUNT chip, new module app/console/strategy/tax-settings.tsx); `requireTypedConfirmation` PROMOTED to USER_LEVEL_POLICY_FIELDS (one switch spans all accounts; divergent per-account values superseded, no legacy seed - fails safe to required); learning review verified already user-level; deep-links retargeted (#models-green -> /console/strategy#models etc.); new regression test in per-account-policy-isolation. Rollout: docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-settings-global-only.md.
- **Green/Red picker label coloring + Green Team/Red Team/Bull/Bear copy sweep (CLAUDE, branch
  `claude/green-red-labels`) — COMPLETED 2026-07-10.** Owner-directed pure display-copy change.
  Field labels for the two model pickers now read "Proposer Model" / "Reviewer Model" with only
  "Proposer"/"Reviewer" colored (green `var(--con-pos)` / red `var(--con-neg)` via token-color
  spans, never hex; "Model" stays default text color; same font-weight as before) in
  `app/console/settings/models.tsx` and `app/console/strategy/page.tsx`. Helper copy simplified:
  "aka Green Team or Bull" → "Green", "aka Red Team or Bear" → "Red" everywhere in those two
  files' hints/intro copy/missing-model banner, plus the "Proposer (Green Team)"/"Reviewer (Red
  Team)" role label in `app/console/components/model-stats-drawer.tsx` (the info-drawer button
  embedded directly next to both pickers) → "Proposer (Green)"/"Reviewer (Red)". Deliberately did
  NOT touch `approval-card.tsx`, `results/page.tsx`, `decisions/[id]/page.tsx`, or
  `app/console/lib/red-team.ts` — different console pages/areas, out of the
  settings/strategy-models scope; nor any server/lib identifiers, types, logs, or docs (only
  display strings). Verified in both light and dark mode via live preview (`--con-pos`/
  `--con-neg` computed colors matched exactly). Gate green: tsc clean, 315 files / 3351 tests,
  build clean. See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-green-red-labels.md`.
- **2-3 day activity audit: find unresolved issues (MONET, intro-anim session) — COMPLETED
  2026-07-10.** Owner-directed read-only audit of the production Activity feed (07-07..09):
  36-agent workflow (5 domain investigators over the prod DB + repo, adversarial verification
  per finding, ranked synthesis). Verdict: the worst feed incidents (MU 422 storm, UNH/T
  remediation bug, em-dash push drops, Roth Gemini 400s) were already fixed+deployed; remaining
  fix backlog = 3 quiet P1s (Roth proposer token-cap truncation; thesis-tag split-brain feeding
  the learning loop false directives; per-user reflection dedupe with cross-account
  contamination of the live Bull prompt) + P2s (notification-status recorder, placement-uncertain
  misclassification, stale-exit replacement completion, synthetic-stop backoff, LLM failover
  unwired, ~55-site account-attribution sweep) + a P3 batch. Full report:
  `docs/reviews/2026-07-09-activity-feed-audit.md`. Fixes are separate claims.
- **Broker minimum BUMP-TO-FLOOR (MONET) — COMPLETED 2026-07-10, merged as PR #1297
  (`4ef60cd3`).** Owner ruling: sub-minimum orders bump TO the broker floor and place (audited,
  re-reviewed, still policy-evaluated); "skip" is the opt-out. Opening bumps bounded by policy's
  headroomed per-order cap AND remaining daily/hourly/order-count/buying-power budget (no
  self-inflicted cap breaches or authority demotion); sells cap at the full position; dollar
  exits convert to position-bounded quantity orders. Co-finished with the original bump lane
  (competing #1280 closed in #1297's favor; their thread-fix batch + db-proposals sizing
  persistence folded in). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-broker-minimum-bump-to-floor.md`.

- **Enrichment starvation: force-included scan candidates (holdings + event outliers) never
  enriched (MONET, worktree `bold-lamport-20a8f9`, branch `monet/bold-lamport-20a8f9`) — ✅
  COMPLETED 2026-07-10 via PR #1287; PR #1272 closed superseded.** Root cause of "AAPL
  fundamentals all dashes": every enrichment provider sliced its symbol list to `maxSymbols()` =
  30 while `scanMarket` enriches top-`candidateLimit` (30) ranked + up to 8 event outliers + ALL
  held positions — the force-included extras past index 30 (systematically the owner's held
  names; verified in prod 2026-07-09T19:41Z, exactly 30/42 enriched) got zero fields from every
  provider: blank Fundamentals drawer, neutral-50 factor defaults, no fundamentals for the
  LLM/FCF-veto on exactly the owned positions. Final fix (owner ruling 2026-07-09, landed in
  #1287 which merged this branch's content at 90c55579 and revised it): NO hard enrichment cap —
  `maxSymbols()` = Infinity unless `FMP_MAX_SYMBOLS` (explicit, unclamped operator throttle);
  enrichment order hoists ALL held names (incl. inside the ranked top-N) then event outliers;
  tooltip honesty (`withProvenance`/`cellTitle` never stamp "Received <time>" on fields no
  provider returned); regression tests for the 42-symbol prod shape, MARKET_SCAN_LIMIT,
  unclamped override, and no-cap full-list coverage. ROUND 2 (MONET, 2026-07-10): the two
  codex-connector findings that blocked #1272 (held-inside-top-N starvation; user-policy scan
  shapes bypassing an env-derived budget) were fixed on the branch and are both structurally
  addressed on main by #1287's ordering + no-cap; #1272 closed superseded 2026-07-10T05:30Z.
  Deploy: rode the main@597b991c ANNOUNCE-THEN-DEPLOY (claimed 05:35Z; deployer owns

- **MONET usage-cap pickup (CLAUDE, owner-directed, worktree
  `.claude/worktrees/monet-usage-cap-work-0038cf`) — ✅ COMPLETED 2026-07-09 evening.** MONET hit
  its usage cap ~17:05 CDT mid-merge-shepherding; the owner directed CLAUDE to pick up everything
  in flight. Outcome: (a) all 6 blocked MONET PRs landed — #1229/#1222/#1221/#1215/#1193 MERGED,
  #1228 armed post conflict-resolution (26 codex threads triaged with per-thread adversarial
  verification: 20 REAL → fixed with regression tests, 6 resolved-with-note; money-path diffs
  (#1229/#1228) independently diff-reviewed pre-push; round-2 bot findings — 12 more, all real —
  fixed the same way, riding in-PR or via follow-ups #1265 (merged) /#1266/#1267/#1269 (armed));
  (b) un-landed lanes recovered and landed: vitest tmpdir-leak → PR #1268 MERGED, settings-UX
  fixes (incl. the real `policy-diff` looser/tighter classification bug) → PR #1270 MERGED,
  enrichment-starvation → PR #1272 armed; (c) verified already-merged pre-cap, no action:
  #1224 timestamps, #1227 cmd-K badge, #1209 intro fixes (incl. LoadingBrand follow-up),
  #1217 reviewer veto value-add; (d) deferred: 2-3 day activity audit (needs prod DB; Hetzner
  migration was in flight — MONET's to resume), broker-min bump-to-floor (claimed pre-cap, zero
  commits — unclaimed again), PR #1083 (recommend close as duplicate of merged #1082 — owner
  call). NO deploys (honored the migration deploy-hold). Rollout:
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-monet-usage-cap-pickup.md`.
  **ROUND 2 (same evening ~21:45 CDT — MONET re-capped after a productive resumed session; CLAUDE
  picked up again, owner-directed):** MONET's 4 new PRs shepherded — #1279 mistral-capmap, #1280
  bump-to-floor (oversized below-minimum exits now BLOCK instead of full-exit-bumping), #1281
  unsaved-changes (all threads fixed/resolved, armed); #1278 learning-review — adopted MONET's
  uncommitted trigger feature, fixed its 7 threads PLUS a review-caught REAL blocker (max-age
  sweep unreachable for learned rows outside the 7-day window; empirically reproduced,
  regression-tested), armed. Round-3 bot threads on #1266/#1267/#1269 fixed (incl. a spoofable
  flake-rerun marker and an ok:true health log that neutered the new circuit breaker); #1272
  un-dirtied. MONET's aapl lane (owner-ruled NO-CAP enrichment + RAG filings warm-up receipts;
  supersedes #1272 content, ordering documented) committed + landed as PR #1287 (full gate
  3261/3261). All 9 PRs armed, merging on CI. Activity audit REMAINS not-started (MONET's on
  return). Round-2 addendum in the rollout note.
- **Short stop-loss default (8%) + surface short settings in main Essentials (MONET, branch
  `monet/short-stop-default-and-surface`) — NOT YET MERGED: PR #1221 open, auto-merge armed
  2026-07-09 (code complete; this row stays out of the "merged to `main`" sense of Completed
  until the merge actually lands — kept here rather than duplicated under In Progress).**
  Owner-directed fix: enabling short selling with
  otherwise-default settings rejected every short proposal because the mandatory short-stop gate
  (`policy.ts:433`) had nothing to pass by default. `DEFAULT_RISK_RULES` (`src/lib/defaults.ts`)
  now sets `shortStopLossPct: 8` — a real default (not a `?? stopLossPct` gate fallback, per
  owner's explicit instruction) that flows through `mergePolicy`'s `riskRules` deep-merge to every
  policy without an override. Gate logic itself unchanged. Also moved the four `SHORTS` fields
  (`app/console/guardrails/page.tsx`) from a collapsed "Short selling" `AdvancedGroup` in the
  Advanced rulebook card to the bottom of the main Essentials card, and updated the
  `shortStopLossPct` hint copy (`field-defs.ts`) to reflect the new default. Sanity-checked:
  `evaluateTradeProposal` against a default policy with `shortSellingEnabled: true` (no explicit
  stop override) now approves a well-sized short. Gate green: tsc clean, lint 0 errors, 3168
  tests, build clean. See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-short-stop-default-and-surface.md`.
- **Model Stats drawer widened on desktop (MONET, branch `monet/model-stats-drawer-wide`) — COMPLETED
  2026-07-09, merged to `main` via PR #1213 (auto-merge armed).** Owner-directed console-UI fix: the Model Stats drawer's 4-column
  table (Model / Cost / Latency / Realized performance) was cramped inside the shared `Sheet`
  dialog's fixed 560px desktop width. Added an opt-in `wide?: boolean` prop on `Sheet`
  (`app/console/ui/sheet.tsx`) driving a new `.con-sheet-wide` class (`app/console/console.css`,
  `min(920px, calc(100vw - 32px))` on desktop; explicitly re-pinned to `width: 100%` inside the
  existing mobile `@media (max-width: 767px)` block so the bottom-sheet is unaffected). Only
  `ModelStatsButton` (`app/console/components/model-stats-drawer.tsx`) opts in — the other ~12
  `Sheet` call-sites (broker connect, policy review, order cancel/replace, approvals, account-scope
  sheet, etc.) are untouched. Gate green: tsc clean, lint 0 errors, 3168 tests, build clean. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-model-stats-drawer-wide.md`.
- **Intro size-jump + loading-text fix (MONET) — COMPLETED 2026-07-09, merged to `main` as PR #1209.** Owner (prod, both viewports):
  wordmark still has a sudden SIZE change ~1s after the candles assemble; also remove the
  "Socratic Trade / Loading the autonomy desk..." text during load. Diagnosis: (a) the real
  HeaderLogo's canvas starts at width=height*13.8 (magic estimate) then JUMPS to
  height*wm.ar when its own effect runs -> width-only size change; the `13.8` estimate is
  used in header-logo.tsx initial width + shell MobileBrandRow, drifting from the real
  sampler AR; (b) intro-canvas `curHeader` is a per-effect local so a loading->loaded remount
  snaps the box. Fix: export single-source WORDMARK_AR from candle-ticker, use everywhere;
  persist curHeader; drop loading text. Fileset: app/console/ui/candle-ticker.ts,
  app/console/ui/header-logo.tsx, app/console/components/shell.tsx, app/console/components/intro-canvas.tsx.
- **Scoring-factor weight tooltips (MONET, S, branch `monet/scoring-factor-tooltips`) — COMPLETED
  2026-07-09.** Owner-directed display-only pass: added a hover tooltip (existing `Tooltip`
  primitive, `app/console/ui/primitives.tsx`) to each of the 8 "Scoring-factor weights" controls on
  the Strategy console page explaining what the factor measures and which direction more weight
  pushes candidate ranking, plus one sentence in the card intro clarifying the weights are relative
  (ratios matter, not absolute numbers). No scoring-math changes. Gate green: tsc clean, lint 0
  errors, 3168 tests, build clean. PR #1205 (auto-merge armed). See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-scoring-factor-tooltips.md`.
- **Drizzle ORM Migration (AG, branch `ag/drizzle-orm-migration`) — ✅ COMPLETED 2026-07-09 (PR via land.sh).** Refactored the app's database layer to use Drizzle ORM instead of the custom SQLite wrapper. Created schema definition in `src/lib/db/schema.ts` (tables: `settings`, `user_settings`, `market_data_demands` with constraints). Updated `src/lib/db-settings.ts` to fully use Drizzle queries. Verified: linting clean, types pass (`tsc --noEmit`), tests pass (`2970/2970`), and build succeeds. See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-drizzle-orm-migration.md`.
- **Picker copy: "Proposer"/"Reviewer" + AI-review panel "Strategist" (MONET, branch
  `monet/picker-copy-strategist`) — ✅ COMPLETED via PR #1202 (auto-merge armed).** Owner-directed pure display-copy
  follow-up to PR #1109 (`monet/model-picker-copy2`, which added "Model" to the picker labels):
  drops "Model" from both picker labels ("Proposer Model"→"Proposer", "Reviewer Model"→"Reviewer")
  in `app/console/settings/models.tsx` and `app/console/strategy/page.tsx`. This collided with the
  separate AI-review (strategy-tuning) panel's own "Reviewer model" field and its "Same As Red
  Team"/"Same As Green Team" default, so that panel's field is renamed "Strategist" (intro sentence
  now "A strategist model reads...", inherited-label ternary now renders "Reviewer"/"Proposer"). No
  functional/variable-name changes; all other Red Team/Green Team concept names untouched. Gate
  green: tsc clean, lint 0 errors, 3168 tests, build clean. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-picker-copy-strategist.md`.
- Settings affordance and tooltip pass - add clearer option descriptions/tooltips,
  replace confusing loose/tight wording with lock/unlock-style affordances, and
  turn absolute-vs-percent constraint pairs into polished mode switches where
  they represent alternative ways to express one setting.
  2026-07-09 CODEX: COMPLETED via PR #1184 (`8b468260`). Scope was the smallest
  remaining tooltip-only slice: added missing native titles to bare Guardrails controls in
  `app/console/guardrails/page.tsx`. Keepout honored: MONET-owned model-picker/catalog
  files were not touched. Full local gate and GitHub `verify`/smoke were green before
  auto-merge. Not yet production-deployed after `8b468260`; MONET confirmed it rides the
  next natural release.
- Universal ticker detail drawer parity - restore old-site discoverability by
  making ticker symbols open a shared right-side drilldown drawer consistently
  across scan, home, evidence cards, proposals, orders, activity, outcomes,
  approvals, and watchlist.
  2026-07-09 CODEX: COMPLETED via PR #1181 (`70c0698e`). Re-claimed on branch `codex/console-parity-next`
  (`/Users/jay/.codex/worktrees/socratic-codex-console-parity`) after read-only audit of
  `origin/main`. Scope was the smallest remaining gap only: add the existing `SymbolButton`
  affordance to Home evidence cards in `app/console/page.tsx`. Keepout honored: model-picker
  files and drawer host/API files remain MONET-owned/adjacent. Full local gate and GitHub
  `verify`/smoke were green before auto-merge. Not yet production-deployed after `70c0698e`.
- **Mobile chrome bar fixes, 6 owner-reported items (MONET) — DEPLOYED 2026-07-08 via
  `nitgo442` (merged as PR #1173).** Owner (prod phone
  screenshots): (1) account dropdown wider on mobile; (2) Running/Autopilot indicator
  unboxed + stacked two-line small on mobile (looked like a second dropdown); (3) profile
  button 44px tap target on mobile; (4) theme toggle moves INTO the profile menu (off the
  bar); (5) profile menu becomes a slide-DOWN dropdown under the header (old bottom Sheet
  was covered by the mobile tab bar -> sign-out unreachable); (6) profile button shows the
  Google/GitHub avatar (snapshot.currentUser.imageUrl already wired, never rendered); plus
  STOP button squeeze fix (shrink-0 + centered content). Fileset:
  app/console/components/chrome.tsx, app/console/components/shell.tsx (ChromeBar),
  app/console/console.css.
- **Intro landing fixes: viewport-true fallback box + eased retarget + fade gated on real
  logo (MONET) — DEPLOYED 2026-07-08 via `nitgo442` (merged as PR #1170).** Owner-reported on prod: mobile wordmark assembled a few sizes too small then
  popped larger; desktop logo vanished ~1s between overlay fade and full page load. Root
  cause: intro can finish against the loading shell and lands on a stale hard-coded fallback
  box; reveal then has no mounted logo. Fix in `intro-canvas.tsx` only: fallback box now
  matches the real logo geometry per viewport (<lg = MobileBrandRow formula, >=lg = bar
  logo), landing box eases to the measured target instead of snapping, natural fade waits
  for a settled measured target (8s timeout safety; skip stays immediate).
- **Shared-dep proper-usage cleanup refresh (CODEX, S) — completed 2026-07-08 via PR #1171.**
  Replaced dirty Cursor PR #1105 without editing the Cursor branch. Merged to `main`
  as `54b6d722`; #1105 closed as superseded and stale PR #856 closed as obsolete. Cleanup uses
  shared `CONGRESS_EVENT_TYPES` for event-type checks, derives outbound payload typing from shared
  `SharePayload`, and drops unused `API_PATHS`/`MAX_REFS_BATCH` imports. Verified locally and in CI:
  lint 0 errors, tsc clean, 3101 tests, build, smoke, verify, gitleaks, Cursor Approval all green;
  zero active unresolved review threads.
- **Centralize Congress API Client Factory (AG) — COMPLETED 2026-07-08.** Refactored Congress Trade API interaction into a central factory `src/lib/api-clients/congress.ts`. Replaced `src/lib/congress-trade-client.ts`. Updated features to reliably check `CONGRESS_TRADE_READS_ENABLED` and `CONGRESS_TRADE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` gating flags. Verified: tests pass 2970/2970, build green. PR via land.sh.
- **Consolidate usage telemetry clients in consumer apps (AG) — ✅ COMPLETED 2026-07-06 (PR #1005).** Replaced `postBatch` telemetry sending logic with `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared` in Socratic.Trade.

- **Strategy exec/stops/LLM troubleshooting fixes (MONET) — COMPLETED 2026-07-07: PR #1036 squash-merged to `main` @ `e73c66a4` (verify green, auto-merge).** Owner-directed after prod forensics on Alpaca-paper `PA33IDTHMFK9`; all four money-path workstreams delivered + adversarially reviewed (1 HIGH cross-tick double-sell finding fixed+tested pre-merge): (1) DeepSeek effort transparency (no silent medium→high; thinking opt-in; UI shows true effort sent) + reasoning-aware env-tunable timeout (150s thinking) + `llmFetchCapturing` latency/late-reply capture (`llm_call_latency` + `llm_late_response` audits — a paid slow reply is recorded, never severed); (2) protective Risk-Exits route as MARKET (`coerceProtectiveExitToMarket`) + `autoRemediateStaleExitOrders` cancel-replaces stale EXIT limits at the 15m tick (exits only; live+typed-confirm defers to human; in-flight guard + 5-min per-order cooldown against double-sells; `policy.autoRemediateStaleExits` default on); (3) per-trade stops — `atrStops`/`betaScaledStops` default ON, Bull/Bear schemas expose `bracketStopLoss`/`bracketTakeProfit` + prompt guidance, `enrichOpeningProposal` validates + per-symbol fallback (ATR>beta>flat); (4) `ALLOW_LIVE_TRADING` flipped to opt-OUT escape hatch + notification retry on transient failures. Verify: tsc 0 / lint 0 / 2888 tests / build. **OWNER NOTE at next prod deploy: the Robinhood live acct trades on its environment unless `ALLOW_LIVE_TRADING=false`.** Deferred: per-symbol synthetic *trailing* stop (needs beta/ATR in the scheduler-tick monitor). Rollout note `docs/rollouts/2026-07-07-strategy-exec-stops-llm-fixes.md`. _(Correction 2026-07-08, intro-anim MONET session: this is now DEPLOYED — in production since deploy n1v296/rjskkyzx; the OWNER NOTE above is therefore LIVE and was re-surfaced to the owner at the rjskkyzx release. Mirror row flip rides the release-close-out docs PR.)_
- **Run the as-of epoch Pinecone backfill (ops, MONET) — COMPLETED 2026-07-07 (ops run done; docs PR #1033 squash-merged to `main`).** The deferred operational follow-up from CLAUDE's #1019 (server-asof-filter): executed `scripts/backfill-asof-epoch.ts` against the shared default Pinecone index, operator ("local") key — dry-run → real run → idempotency re-run. Counts: 341 scanned / **309 updated** / 32 already epoch'd (post-#1019 ingests) / **0 undated / 0 errors**; re-run = 341/341 skippedHasEpoch, 0 updated. Corpus fully epoch-stamped: `VECTOR_ASOF_SERVER_FILTER=on` now safe AND effective; `VECTOR_ASOF_STRICT=on` would currently drop nothing (no undated vectors exist). Rollout note `docs/rollouts/2026-07-07-asof-epoch-backfill-run.md`. **UPDATE 2026-07-08 (owner-directed): `VECTOR_ASOF_SERVER_FILTER=on` is now LIVE in prod** — set in Infisical prod (authoritative) + Coolify app env (redundant copy, pending cleanup), container restarted on the Coolify box (deployment `umphe8pw`, finished, health green: db ok / scheduler 7s / pinecone ok). Confirmed prod `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=socratic-trade` == code default, so the backfilled index IS the one prod queries. `VECTOR_ASOF_STRICT` remains OFF (backtest-lane choice). The flip fight also surfaced: box disk-full incident (owner freed, 15GB now), a zombie-deployment queue jam, and a Coolify cancel-API bug (500 but works) — details on #agent-sync 2026-07-08. **CLOSED 2026-07-08 with the env-split cleanup:** ADMIN_HOST + AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN moved into Infisical prod, redundant Coolify copies (incl. the flag) deleted — Coolify app envs are now bootstrap-only and Infisical prod is the single source of truth for app runtime config. Parity restart verified in the app process via box SSH (`/proc/<pid>/environ`): all 3 keys correct, litestream→R2 replicating (health's litestreamState=unknown is a blind metric — fix task chip spawned), health green.
- **PRs #1019 / #1021 - CLAUDE RAG: server-side as-of Pinecone filter + persist-pool v2 (2 owner-approved
  deferred items).** Both merged to `main` 2026-07-06 (verify/smoke/gitleaks green, auto-merge).
  Owner approved the design (fail-open + strict escalation). **#1019 server-side as-of filter:** writes a
  numeric `as_of_epoch_ms` at ingest (cleanMetadata) and pushes the point-in-time constraint INTO the
  Pinecone query (`$or:[{$lte},{$exists:false}]` fail-OPEN by default; the post-fetch `isWithinAsOf` guard
  stays the unconditional leakage backstop) so topK fills with ELIGIBLE chunks instead of being decimated
  post-fetch (fixes backtest "empty small pools"). `VECTOR_ASOF_STRICT` escalates to fail-CLOSED for
  certified backtests; `VECTOR_ASOF_SERVER_FILTER` operator gate (default OFF); idempotent non-destructive
  metadata backfill (`scripts/backfill-asof-epoch.ts`, dry-run-able) — run it before enabling. Review
  confirmed Pinecone v8 `update` MERGES metadata (backfill can't corrupt the corpus) and the `$and`/scope-`$or`
  composition doesn't widen scope. **#1021 persist-pool v2:** captures the PRE-`rankPool` `matches` pool with
  per-stage drop dispositions (minScore/asOf/dedupe/dedupe_truncate/rerank-floor/rerank-truncate/not-used/used)
  via an optional `rankPool` hook — closes v1's post-rankPool-only limitation. `RAG_PERSIST_CANDIDATE_POOL_FULL`
  (default OFF, byte-identical when off). Review caught + fixed: `dropped_dedupe` mislabeling limit-cap
  truncation (new `dropped_dedupe_truncate`), an id-less-rerank-survivor mislabel, and hardened BOTH v1+v2
  captures so a capture bug can never empty a retrieval. All advisory/observability-only; flags default-off; no
  MONET/CODEX/AG lane files touched. Rollout notes: docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-server-asof-filter.md,
  -persist-pool-v2.md. (These close the two follow-ups deferred from the 2026-07-06 next-wave RAG cluster.)
- **Accessible tooltip/popover primitive everywhere (AG, S)** — ✅ COMPLETED 2026-07-06. Added a reusable `Tooltip` primitive to `app/console/ui/primitives.tsx` supporting accessible hover/focus. Performed a console-native title replacement pass upgrading `Chip`, `Stat`, `Ago`, `TickerLogo`, and `ProviderLogo` to use the Tooltip component instead of native `title` attributes.

- **Retire duplicate API client in Socratic.Trade (CURSOR, M)** — ✅ COMPLETED 2026-07-06. Branch `cursor/retire-client-dups`. Replaced local `SseParser` class and `createSubscription`/`streamUrl` in `congress-stream.ts` with shared `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared` imports (`SseParser`, `CongressTradeClient`). Updated shared-dep to v1.4.1. Bumped `congress-trade-client.ts` to use `CongressTradeClient` for all endpoints (bundle/ref/refs/prices/spx/fundamentals/analyst/transactions/analytics) with preserved feature gates, health logging, and timeout logic. All 62 congress tests pass, tsc clean.

  Triage-first (9 rows: 3 already-done, 1 deferred for owner design, 5 built) → adversarial review
  (caught a real corpus-coverage daily-false-positive BLOCKER + a cross-lane held-scope/typed-status
  fallback bug + nits, all fixed pre-merge) → sequential land under strict branch protection
  (Copilot threads resolved per PR). #970 typed retrieval-status receipt; #973 episodic golden-eval +

  #977 corpus-coverage receipt (both-conditions on 10-k/10-q, low-noise); #979 flag-gated candidate-

  default-OFF; no MONET/CODEX/AG lane files touched. Rollout notes: docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-*.
  Deferred (owner decision): server-side numeric as-of Pinecone filter; persist-pool v2 pre-rankPool
  drop capture. Repo-mirror rows + session rollout note closed out via a follow-up docs PR.
- **Congress Score Eval UI Wiring (AG) — ✅ COMPLETED 2026-07-06.** Wired `congressScoreVerdict` into the `MarketScanTab` on the console dashboard. The signal verdict, stats, and gating status are now explicitly surfaced in the UI. Lint, tsc, and Next.js build all pass.

- **PR #844 - `claude/pr805-remediation`: P0 checkRegimeFlip RMW fix + P1 backlog + AG connection-health
  slice, merged as one honest PR (CURSOR + AG + CLAUDE remediation) — ✅ COMPLETED, merged 2026-07-05
  (squash `ebcf6a23`).**
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3): Origin-verified CRITICAL correction — the cycle-2 rows across this
  board asserting the P0 multi-user regime RMW race and security headers are NOT on `main`, and that
  CONFLICTING PR #805 is "the only vehicle," are now FALSE. #844 landed: per-user
  `regime:current:${userId}` keys + legacy-row migration in `src/lib/regime-watch.ts` (confirmed
  present); HSTS/X-Content-Type-Options/Permissions-Policy response headers in `middleware.ts` +
  `test/security-headers.test.ts` (confirmed present); `LLM_SPEND_CEILING`; and the effort-orphan
  report. #844 merged BOTH the Cursor P0/P1 commit (`0ce39474`) and the AG connection-health slice
  (`b88981c4`) cleanly onto `main`, plus fixed all 16 Codex review comments from #805 (each thread
  replied + resolved). PR #805 (`cursor/session-2026-07-05`) is CLOSED as superseded — no action
  needed on it. This supersedes and closes out: the "PR #808" row (previously Completed, moved
  here), the "Admin connection health and backend-failure notification pass (AG)" row (previously In
  Progress, moved here), and the cycle-2 "Disentangle PR #805" / "Migrate legacy regime:current row"
  Planned rows (retired as moot, see the strikethrough notes on those rows). Gate green via land.sh:
  lint 0, tsc clean, 2644 tests, build ok. Full prior resolution history (phantom-PR discovery,
  CONFLICTING diagnosis, RESOLVED note naming #844 as the real vehicle) is preserved on the two
  relocated placeholder rows in Completed rather than deleted._
  Scope landed: **P0 fix** — removed `"local"` default from `checkRegimeFlip`, per-user regime keys
  (`regime:current:${userId}`), per-user scheduler iteration, eliminating the multi-user RMW race on
  a single `regime:current` settings row, plus first-tick migration of the legacy shared row. **P1
  backlog** — security response headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Permissions-Policy),
  unpriced-model default cost fallback, synthetic bid/ask boolean provenance, scheduler health
  threshold, operator monthly LLM spend ceiling (`LLM_SPEND_CEILING`), effort-mirror orphan report
  script, Litestream PITR retention. Global symbol omnibox remained blocked by Codex console/UI
  keepout (not in this PR). **AG connection-health slice** — every backend dependency surfaced in
  `/api/health` and `ops-snapshot` (Database, Pinecone, Voyage, FMP, Massive, etc.); health check
  fails (503) on critical global outages (5 consecutive failures on Database/Pinecone/Voyage); global
  connection failures routed to admin (Sentry, audit log, `PRIMARY_USER_EMAIL` via Resend) while
  user-key failures stay on user in-app notifications; disk headroom, DB+WAL size, and Litestream
  last-sync age monitoring integrated with cooldown-controlled degradation alerts.

## 🚧 In Progress
- **Raise RAG Ingestion Limits and Deepen Filing Lookback (AG, branch `agent/antigravity`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-12.** Raised `RAG_INGEST_MAX_TEXTS_PER_DAY` to 1M and `RAG_PINECONE_MAX_WRITE_UNITS_PER_DAY` to 10M to allow massive ingestion. Deepened historical 10-K/10-Q filing lookback to 10 each per ticker and raised `DEFAULT_PAID_MAX_FILINGS_PER_RUN` to 200.

- **Native iOS App Overhaul (Antigravity, branch `agent/antigravity`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-12.** Replaced the legacy iOS starter app with a native SwiftUI application (`ios/`) using `xcodegen`. Includes tabbed navigation (Dashboard, Proposals, Watchlist), `MobileStore` persistence, and `MobileAPIClient`. Assessed Cloudflare hosting vs current Hetzner server and decided to keep it on Hetzner to avoid splitting the database. Verified build via `xcodebuild`. Ready to merge.

- **Global learning reads + batched AI review of proposals (CLAUDE cloud, branch
  `claude/socratic-trade-logos-p0hxk7`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-07, PR pending.** Lessons (on
  `socratic_decisions`) + framework proposals now read GLOBAL across a user's accounts (dropped the
  active-account filter on the dashboard learning panels; still write `connected_account_id` for
  provenance — no migration; also fixes the dashboard-vs-decision-detail inconsistency). New
  `src/lib/framework-review.ts` `reviewPendingFrameworkProposals`: one LLM call adjudicates all pending
  proposals across accounts and attaches an ADVISORY recommendation (verdict + rationale + optional
  rewrite) via a new nullable `ai_review` column — owner still decides (not auto-apply); reviewer model =
  `redTeamLlmModel`→`llmModel`. Wired `POST /api/socratic/framework/review` + "AI review pending" UI in
  `app/console/page.tsx`. Merged latest `origin/main` (incl. Tradier broker #1425) clean 2026-07-11;
  full gate green (tsc 0, lint 0 errors, **3745 tests pass**, build exit 0). All 11 Codex review threads
  resolved. Awaiting CI + owner merge. See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-07-global-learning-and-batched-review.md`.
- **Public auth + paid-route rate-limit hardening (CODEX, branch
  `codex/public-auth-rate-limit-hardening`) — MERGED TO `main` 2026-07-11 at `97152c25`; live deploy not independently verified.** Bounded security batch from
  the whole-app reliability audit: key the public Robinhood OAuth callback limiter by client IP
  before authentication (never by attacker-controlled OAuth state), bound and expire the in-process
  limiter's key space, parse `CF_ACCESS_TRUST_EMAIL_HEADER` with explicit truth semantics so `0` is
  off while Auth.js remains fail-closed, and apply a named per-user limiter plus one-in-flight guard
  to paid strategy tuning. Code and full Node 24 gate were green (lint 0 errors, TypeScript clean,
  319 files / 3,499 tests, Next build clean). 2026-07-11 CODEX correction: PR #1399 is present on
  `origin/main`; main-push auto-deploy is configured, but this session did not verify the production
  revision. Follow-up `codex/admin-rate-limits` consolidates public tuning with the admin dry-run lock.
  Scope excludes active broker/DB lanes (`connected-accounts`, `alpaca.ts`, `db-api-keys.ts`,

- **Privacy Policy + Terms and Conditions pages for Twilio verification (MONET, branch
  `monet/privacy-terms-pages`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10, code+tests+full gate done, PR opening
  next.** Owner needs live URLs for Twilio's toll-free/A2P SMS verification. Added
  `/privacy-policy` + `/terms-and-conditions` (boilerplate, matches the existing
  `/how-it-works`/`/welcome` page pattern exactly), describing the app's real opt-in Twilio SMS
  notification channel (`src/lib/notify.ts`) with the specific language Twilio's compliance review
  looks for: opt-in consent, message frequency varies, rates may apply, STOP/HELP, no sale of phone
  numbers. Registered in `sitemap.ts`/`robots.ts`. Caught the actual would-be-verification-breaker:
  `middleware.ts` redirects every unauthenticated path to `/login` by default — added both new
  paths to `PUBLIC_PREFIXES` so an unauthenticated visitor (e.g. Twilio's reviewer) can actually see
  them. Verified live via `next dev` (Browser preview tool): both pages render full content
  unauthenticated, correct title, matching site styling. node@24: tsc clean, eslint 0-err, full
  suite 315/3395, build clean (both pages static `○`). See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-privacy-terms-pages.md`.

- **Learning Review: explicit "defer" verdict for unsure items (CLAUDE, branch
  `claude/learning-review-defer`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10, owner-directed; isolated throwaway
  worktree off `origin/main` @ `c7a2fa95` (the originally-assigned worktree had unrelated dirty
  per-team-reasoning follow-up work left in it — untouched).** The daily Learning Review LLM
  (`src/lib/learning-review.ts`) can now emit a `"defer"` verdict (distinct from
  keep/reject/expire/needs_more_data) when it genuinely cannot decide, WITH a required non-blank
  reasoning note (`parseLearningReviewVerdicts` drops blank-note defers as malformed, same as any
  other invalid entry). For `learned_context_pending` rows this leaves the item exactly pending
  (no approve/reject) and persists the note to a new `review_note` column
  (`src/lib/db.ts`/`db-learning.ts`, guarded ALTER for existing DBs +
  `setPendingLearnedContextReviewNote`), surfaced in the queue UI
  (`app/console/approvals/learned-context.tsx`, new `ReviewerNote` "Left for you because..." small
  muted line using the existing `--con-*` token pattern). For durable `learned_context` rows it's a
  no-op (no queue to leave it in), matching `needs_more_data`. Verified (new test) that a deferred
  item does NOT force a same-set re-review loop — it rides the EXISTING #1278/#1328
  marker/fingerprint architecture unchanged (sticks until a human acts or another item's arrival
  brings the reviewer back to the whole set); no separate re-review scheduler was added. +6 tests in
  `test/learning-review.test.ts` (52/52 in the 3 learning-review-adjacent suites). Gate green: tsc
  clean, 3389 tests / 315 files, build clean, lint 0 errors. Rollout:

  settings-global-only on the live board; includes the 2026-07-10 scope add: usage link + Learning
  Review "Model settings" links).** New account-scoped `TradingPolicy.redTeamReasoningEffort`
  (mirrors `redTeamLlmModel` naming); legacy `llmReasoningEffort` = the PROPOSER's; reviewer falls
  back until explicitly set via the single helper `resolveReviewerReasoningEffort`
  (src/lib/llm-request.ts), wired at red-team.ts / strategy-tuning.ts / the AI-review panel.
  `validatePolicy` rejects a gpt-5.5+high combo on EITHER team, naming the team. Framework UI:
  per-seat reasoning selects (shown only when that model supports it), curated per-model advice from
  NEW `src/lib/model-reasoning-recommendations.ts` (gpt-5.5 interactive-high rule surfaced BEFORE
  save; High disabled in-select), reviewer "Same as proposer (…)" inherit option; rotating seats
  hide the manual control — `resolveModelRotationForRun` now auto-sets each rotated model's curated
  recommended effort (unknown → medium) on the run-scoped override, audited on
  `model_rotation_pick`. Plus "LLM usage & cost" link (Models card → /console/usage) and "Model
  settings" links on both approvals Learning Review blocks → new Settings `#learning-review` anchor.
  Gate green (tsc / lint 0-err / 3383 tests / build) + live browser smoke of all four items. PR via
  land.sh (number recorded on the live board once open). Rollout:
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-per-team-reasoning.md`.
- **AUTO-DEPLOY ON — merge-to-main auto-deploys prod (MONET, branch `monet/auto-deploy-on`) — DONE +
  PROVEN 2026-07-10, PR pending via land.sh.** Owner-directed: production now auto-deploys on every push
  to `main` (merge == live). Fixes: (1) Coolify native `is_auto_deploy_enabled=true` on
  `socratic-trade-prod` (DB-only setting, done via box SSH — API is CF-blocked); (2) whitelisted
  GitHub's stable **webhook** IP ranges (40 `/24` + IPv6) on the `jays.services` CF IP-allowlist that
  was 403'ing them (bot protection stays on elsewhere). End-to-end proven: `e9e9138b` webhook deploy
  (`is_webhook=t`) FINISHED; prod = `main` HEAD, healthy. **ANNOUNCE-THEN-DEPLOY RETIRED** — fleet must
  stop manual deploy claims/triggers. Rollback: `is_auto_deploy_enabled=false`. Diagnosed + handed AG a
  pre-existing deploy incident (transient git-clone window + zombie deploy holding the build queue; now
  resolved). See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-auto-deploy-on.md`; AGENTS.md + AGENT-SYNC.md updated.
- **Activity-audit item 10: account-attribution sweep in `strategy.ts` + `synthetic-stops.ts` (CLAUDE, branch `claude/audit-item10-attribution`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10, built and locally committed, not yet pushed/landed.** Picked up the RESERVED row (split out of MONET's P1 batch per owner). Threaded `connectedAccountId` into all 54 in-scope `audit()` sites that had it available but omitted it: 41 in `src/lib/strategy.ts` (`runStrategyOnce`'s local const; `policy.connectedAccountId` in every function that already takes a full `policy` param — `resolveScanScoringWeights`, `applyCorrelationClusterGate`, `applyEarningsBlackoutTag`, `applyRiskReceipts`, `applyDeterministicSizing`, `executeProposal`; `autoRevertOnCapBreach`'s own audit call now uses the param it already had; `recordLlmOutcome` ctx + `reconcilePendingFills`/`flagStalePlacingIntents` gained an optional trailing `connectedAccountId` param, wired at their `runStrategyOnce` call sites) + all 13 `audit()` sites in `src/lib/synthetic-stops.ts` (one more than the report's "12" — `broker_protective_stop_reconcile_error` fixed too for consistency, same function scope). `strategy_bull_truncated` + post-mortem.ts/`setUserSetting` left untouched — already fixed by the P1 batch. Zero behavior changes to trading logic (4th-arg audit attribution + two new optional trailing params only). Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, eslint 0 errors (9 pre-existing grandfathered warnings), 46 focused test files / 523 tests green under node@24 (all `strategy-*`/`synthetic-stops`/sizing/gate/veto/wash-sale/reconciliation/scheduler suites touching these two files). Full gate (`npm test` full run + `npm run build`) deferred to the Land phase. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-audit-item10-attribution-sweep.md`.

- **Framework Models card truth fixes — Proposer blank-select display + Reviewer "inherits
  proposer" false copy (CLAUDE, branch `claude/models-card-truth`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10,
  follow-up to the per-team-reasoning effort below.** Two pre-existing `app/console/strategy/page.tsx`
  issues logged as follow-ups when PR #1346 landed: (1) the Proposer `ModelSelect` had no blank
  option, so an unconfigured Proposer's native `<select>` visually fell back to showing "Rotate all
  models (testing)" even though nothing was chosen — fixed with a new `blankDisabled` placeholder
  option ("Not set — choose a model"). (2) The Reviewer hint/blank-label said "Blank = same as
  proposer" / "Same As Proposer", but `resolveRoleModel(policy, "red")`
  (`src/lib/llm-provider.ts`) never falls back to the Proposer model — a blank Reviewer fails CLOSED
  to human review (`debateProposal`'s `not_configured`, `src/lib/red-team.ts`, owner directive
  2026-07-07). Fixed the copy to state the real consequence and audited every display use of the
  page's `effectiveRedTeamModel = redTeamModel || proposerModel` (killed that derivation; reasoning
  control, summary line, and per-model advice now read the Reviewer's own `redTeamModel` directly).
  Reasoning-EFFORT inheritance (a real, separate mechanism) is unchanged. Display/copy only — no
  resolution behavior changed; owner question on whether blank SHOULD inherit is surfaced in the
  PR description, not resolved here. Gate green (tsc clean / 3383 tests / build clean / lint 0-err).
  Landed via `scripts/land.sh` as standalone PR #1349 off `origin/main`, auto-merge armed (PR #1346's branch was already

  green, auto-merge armed. #1278 squash-merged to `main` mid-work (`6f1aaf87`), so rebased onto `main`
  (single commit) — standalone follow-up, not stacked.** `seedLegacyLearningReviewFields`
  (`src/lib/db-profiles.ts`) bailed whenever any `learningReview*` key was present in
  `user_settings.policy`; a legacy FULL blob stamps the DEFAULT `learningReviewEnabled:false` there
  while the real enabled review lives account-scoped (#1116), so a pre-cutover enabled review silently
  read as disabled. Fix = (1) full-blob-vs-tiered disambiguation (`isTieredWrite = every stored key is
  user-level`) so a tiered `pickUserFields` write's review key is authoritative but a full blob's is a
  stale default to seed over, and (2) a one-time `learning_review:legacySeedDone:<userId>` marker set
  unconditionally on first read so the seed only ever evaluates pre-deploy state and can never re-fire to
  clobber a later deliberate disable (the fail-OPEN danger the naive fix risked). +2 tests
  (full-blob recovered; tiered-disable NOT clobbered), pre-fix falsified. node@24: tsc clean,
  learning-review 32/32, policy-scope 53/53 (pr7-merge-gate green), build clean, eslint 0-err. Built off

  covering the page during the waving-chart phase, then dissolves (0.9s) to reveal the console/page
  skeleton once the candles start moving up (resolves the transparent-vs-theme-bg question as a

  typed "Socratic.Trade" top-bar brand with a live candlestick "SOCRATIC TRADE" `<HeaderLogo>` that
  ticks forever (one column/sec), and made the intro shrink into and hand off to that exact element.
  New shared `app/console/ui/candle-ticker.ts` (wordmark sampler + 12-unit ticker + `drawTicker`, so
  intro and logo can't drift) + `app/console/ui/header-logo.tsx` (~248×18px, theme-independent candles
  on the header surface, reduced-motion-safe). `intro-canvas.tsx`: transparent bg (owner choice), final
  candles measured onto the real `[data-brand-logo]` box (seamless handoff), header shrunk to ~18px,
  `END=T4+0.2` (fade at once, no double-draw). tsc/lint/build green + driven live (dark + light).

  of all four items). Owner-directed; includes the 2026-07-10 scope add (usage link + Learning
  Review "Model settings" links).** New account-scoped `TradingPolicy.redTeamReasoningEffort`
  (mirrors `redTeamLlmModel` naming); legacy `llmReasoningEffort` = the PROPOSER's; reviewer falls
  back until explicitly set via the single helper `resolveReviewerReasoningEffort`
  (src/lib/llm-request.ts), wired at red-team.ts / strategy-tuning.ts / the AI-review panel.
  `validatePolicy` rejects a gpt-5.5+high combo on EITHER team, naming the team. Framework UI:
  per-seat reasoning selects (shown only when that model supports it), curated per-model advice from
  NEW `src/lib/model-reasoning-recommendations.ts` (gpt-5.5 interactive-high rule surfaced BEFORE

- **Plain-English Anthropic usage-limit error (CLAUDE, cloud lane, 2026-07-06).** Owner reported a
  screenshot where a Roth IRA thesis card's "⚠ RED TEAM FAILED (provider error)" note showed a raw
  Anthropic JSON error blob (`{"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"You
  have reached your specified API usage limits...` verbatim, including `request_id`) instead of
  plain English. Root cause: `humanizeLlmError` (`src/lib/llm-errors.ts`) already recognizes
  401/403/404/429/5xx/timeout/context-length shapes, but Anthropic's org/workspace-level "specified
  API usage limit" comes back as a 400 `invalid_request_error` — not a 429 — so it fell through to
  the generic `${provider} error: ${rawText}` fallback and dumped the JSON body. Fix: added a
  dedicated `usage limit`/`usage limits` branch that extracts the "regain access on <date>" text (if
  present) and returns a plain-English sentence naming the provider and reset time, with no raw JSON.
  This is the single chokepoint most call sites (red-team.ts, strategy.ts, outcome-engine.ts,
  post-mortem.ts, proposal-revalidation.ts, strategy-tuning.ts, the Assistant console) already route
  through, so the fix applies everywhere those reasons/rationale strings surface. New regression test
  in `test/llm-errors.test.ts` pins the exact screenshot payload → plain-English, no `{`/`request_id`
  in output. Files: `src/lib/llm-errors.ts`, `test/llm-errors.test.ts`. Verification: `npx tsc
  --noEmit` clean; `npm run lint` 0 errors; `npm test` 2674/2674 passed; `npm run build` fails with a
  pre-existing `/_not-found` "Invalid URL" collection error reproduced identically on a clean stash
  of `main` (unrelated to this change, likely a missing env var in this cloud environment — not a
  regression). See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-plain-english-anthropic-usage-limit-error.md`.
- **PR #979 - Persist retrieved candidate pool for RAG analyzability (CLAUDE, branch
  `claude/persist-candidate-pool`).** Merged 2026-07-06. Captures the post-recall/post-dedupe
  candidate pool from `retrieveContextDetailed` (`vector-db.ts`) — including chunks NOT making the
  final top-`limit` slice — behind new flag `RAG_PERSIST_CANDIDATE_POOL` (default OFF,
  byte-identical when off). **Known limitation:** it captures `rankPool`'s OUTPUT pool only, so
  candidates dropped upstream by minScore/asOf/dedupe are never present, and in the flagship
  production caller (dedupe 0.6 + limit 3, both of which already hard-cap output at `limit`)
  `used:false` rows are rare/absent — a pre-rankPool v2 with per-stage drop reasons is the real
  follow-up (see rollout note, and the deferred-work row below). New
  `src/lib/rag/candidate-pool.ts` (`recordCandidatePool` → `audit("rag_candidate_pool", ...)`, no
  new table); ids/scores/docType/asOf/`used` only, never raw chunk text. `RetrieveOptions.runId`
  added (additive) and threaded from both `strategy.ts` retrieval call sites +
  `experience-memory.ts`. Coordinated with sibling lane `claude/typed-retrieval-status` (same file,
  disjoint region — this lane owns only the block right before the final slice; landed after it).
  Local verify: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `test/persist-candidate-pool.test.ts` (new) +
  `test/rag-retrieval-regression.test.ts` 26/26 green, plus spot-checked adjacent RAG/strategy/
  experience-memory suites, no regressions; `land.sh` full gate (tsc/test/build) green at merge.
  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-persist-candidate-pool.md`.
- **PR #1019 - Server-side point-in-time (as-of) filtering in Pinecone (CLAUDE, worktree
  `trading-wt-asof-server`, branch `claude/server-asof-filter`).** Merged 2026-07-06. Owner-approved
  deferred item from the CLAUDE next-wave RAG triage (see the "DEFERRED" bullet above). Pushes the
  backtest `asOf` constraint INTO the Pinecone query so topK is filled with eligible (pre-asOf)
  candidates instead of being decimated by the post-fetch as-of drop — the "empty/small pools in
  backtests" bug, where the pure-vector top-K is dominated by too-recent filings that then get
  dropped post-fetch, even though older eligible filings exist in the corpus but rank below the fetch
  window. Ingest: `cleanMetadata` (`src/lib/vector-db.ts`) additively stamps a numeric
  `as_of_epoch_ms` on every newly-upserted vector (absent when undated — the fail-open signal).
  Query: new flag `VECTOR_ASOF_SERVER_FILTER` (default OFF) AND-combines a server epoch clause with
  the existing symbol/scope/docType filter — **FAIL-OPEN** by default
  (`$or:[{as_of_epoch_ms:{$lte:X}},{as_of_epoch_ms:{$exists:false}}]`, keeps un-epoch'd vectors so an
  un-backfilled corpus isn't dropped), escalating to **FAIL-CLOSED** (plain `{$lte}`, drops un-epoch'd
  server-side) under existing `VECTOR_ASOF_STRICT` for leakage-certified backtests. The post-fetch
  `isWithinAsOf` guard in `rankPool` stays as the leakage backstop regardless (defense in depth); `asOf`
  unset or the flag off means filter output is byte-identical to before. Verified against the installed
  `@pinecone-database/pinecone@8.0.0` client that `$exists`/`$or`/`$lte` all typecheck and forward
  through the opaque filter object — no design compromise needed. New idempotent backfill
  `scripts/backfill-asof-epoch.ts` + `backfillAsOfEpoch()`/`computeBackfillEpochUpdate` (iterates the
  index via `listPaginated`+`fetch`, partial-updates vectors lacking the epoch, `BACKFILL_DRY_RUN=1`
  supported, emits a `vector_asof_epoch_backfill` audit record). New
  `test/vector-db-asof-server-filter.test.ts` (10 tests: filter shape fail-open/strict, byte-identical
  off-path, fail-open + post-fetch backstop, ingest epoch write, backfill pure fn + orchestrator +
  dry-run). Local verify: `tsc --noEmit` clean; targeted suite (`vector-db-asof-server-filter` +
  `vector-db-asof-strict` + `rag-retrieval-regression`) 34/34 passing; broader vector-db/RAG spot-check
  114/114 passing; `land.sh` full gate (tsc/test/build) green at merge. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-server-asof-filter.md`.
  **Follow-up (operational, not yet done):** run `scripts/backfill-asof-epoch.ts` against prod
  (dry-run first via `BACKFILL_DRY_RUN=1`) before flipping `VECTOR_ASOF_SERVER_FILTER=on` — fail-open
  keeps retrieval safe either way, but the topK-fill improvement only reaches the pre-epoch corpus
  after the backfill completes. Both `VECTOR_ASOF_SERVER_FILTER` and `VECTOR_ASOF_STRICT` remain
  default OFF pending that operator step.
- **PR #1021 - persist-pool-v2: pre-rankPool candidate pool + per-stage drop dispositions (CLAUDE,
  worktree `trading-wt-pool-v2`, branch `claude/persist-pool-v2`).** Merged 2026-07-06. Owner-approved
  deferred follow-up to #979, which honestly captures only `rankPool`'s OUTPUT pool (post
  minScore/asOf/hybrid/rerank/dedupe) — candidates dropped upstream were invisible. v2 closes that
  gap: `rankPool` (vector-db.ts) gained an OPTIONAL `onDispositions` hook that tracks every candidate
  through each filtering stage (minScore → asOf → rerank-truncate → post-rerank floor → dedupe →
  kept_not_used/used), byte-identical/zero-cost when the hook is omitted (every existing call site).
  `retrieveContextDetailed` wires a NEW, independent flag `RAG_PERSIST_CANDIDATE_POOL_FULL` (default
  OFF, envFlagOn) that captures the PRE-`rankPool` `matches` pool (raw Pinecone recall, or the #822
  fused multi-query pool) plus the disposition map via `recordCandidatePoolFull` (new fn in
  `src/lib/rag/candidate-pool.ts`, distinct audit kind `rag_candidate_pool_full`) — v1 and v2 toggle
  independently. Same "never persist raw text" posture as v1 (ids/scores/relevanceScore/docType/
  asOf/disposition only). Coordinated with sibling lane `claude/server-asof-filter` (PR #1019, also
  edited `rankPool`'s as-of stage and landed first) — this lane wraps whatever asOf logic exists
  rather than re-deriving it, so the merge-forward was mechanical.
  **Review fixes (same day, pre-merge):** fixed 4 review findings, all observability-only (no change
  to retrieved/used chunks): (1) new `dropped_dedupe_truncate` disposition + a `dedupeSimilar`
  optional `report` out-param so genuine near-dup drops are no longer conflated with `dedupeSimilar`'s
  own internal top-`limit` cap truncation (was mislabeling almost every flagship-config run,
  `limit=3`/`dedupeSimilarity=0.6`); (2) fixed an id-less match that survives rerank being mislabeled
  `dropped_rerank_truncate` (rerank's spread-copy breaks object identity for id-less survivors too)
  via a `__poolKey` stamp that survives the copy; (3) wrapped both the v1 and v2 observability-
  capture blocks in their own try/catch so a capture throw can never empty out a successful
  retrieval; (4) added a defensive 500-candidate hard cap on `recordCandidatePoolFull`'s persisted
  payload. Local verify: `tsc --noEmit` clean; `test/persist-candidate-pool.test.ts` (9/9),
  `test/persist-candidate-pool-v2.test.ts` (14/14), `test/rag-retrieval-regression.test.ts` (28/28)
  — 51/51 total; `test/rag-dedupe-similar.test.ts` 15/15; `eslint` 0 errors on all touched files;
  `land.sh` full gate (tsc/test/build) green at merge. See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-persist-pool-v2.md`
  (including its "Review fixes" section).
- **PR #977 - Corpus-coverage receipt for requested-but-empty filings doc types (CLAUDE, branch
  `claude/corpus-coverage-receipt`).** Merged 2026-07-06. Advisory-only per-run receipt: when
  strategy.ts's filings-RAG pass requests a doc type that produces zero chunks THIS run, emits one
  `audit('rag_doc_type_coverage_empty')` + one kind-`safety` decision-case evidence item. Never
  touches `ragContext`/sizing/policy — advisory only, no flag (mirrors the unconditional
  `evidence_age_anomaly` receipt). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-corpus-coverage-receipt.md`.
  - **2026-07-06 BLOCKER fix (same day, pre-merge):** the original design gated the receipt on
    "zero ever-ingested `ingested_accessions` rows corpus-wide" as the producer-existence check.
    That signal was itself broken: the default-ON 8-K SUMMARY writer
    (`src/lib/web-sources/sec8k.ts`'s `refreshEightK`, via `storeContexts`) writes retrievable
    `doc_type: "8-k"` chunks but never calls `insertIngestedAccession` — only the default-OFF
    full-body writer does. So `ingested_accessions` had ZERO "8-k" rows in the default config even
    with real 8-K chunks in the corpus, meaning the receipt false-fired "8-k" on any day an 8-K
    chunk didn't rank top-3 — routinely, not rarely. Investigated `document_chunks` as a
    corpus-truth replacement (the reviewer's suggestion) and confirmed it's not viable: no
    `doc_type` column in its schema, not populated unconditionally by every writer, and
    `source`/prefix values aren't a reliable per-doc_type proxy (`disclosure-rag.ts` shares one
    prefix across two different doc types). Fixed per the task's documented fallback: dropped the
    runtime `ingested_accessions` producer-count entirely; added a static
    `COVERAGE_CHECKED_DOC_TYPES = ["10-k", "10-q", "8-k"]` allowlist (`src/lib/strategy.ts`) of
    doc types hand-verified to have a producer in code; `computeEmptyDocTypes`
    (`src/lib/prompt-safety.ts`) narrowed to `(coverageCheckedDocTypes, retrievedDocTypes)` with no
    DB dependency at all. Also fixed the companion noise finding: `earnings-transcript` (genuine
    zero-producer, no writer anywhere) excluded from `COVERAGE_CHECKED_DOC_TYPES` (stays in the
    harmless retrieval-request literal) so it no longer fires a receipt every single run forever.
    `ingestedAccessionCountForDocType`/`ingestedAccessionCountsByDocType`
    (`src/lib/db-learning.ts`) kept as general-purpose diagnostic helpers (doc comment corrected
    to spell out the "8-k" undercount caveat), just no longer used by this receipt. Added the
    regression test the fix requires (`test/rag-doc-type-coverage.test.ts`, "(c) REGRESSION"):
    stores an 8-K summary chunk with NO `insertIngestedAccession` call anywhere and asserts no
    false-positive receipt for "8-k". 11/11 passing (was 10/10); `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; 42/42 +
    31/31 regression spot-checks unchanged. Full rationale in the rollout note's new "Correction"
    section.
  - **2026-07-06 THIRD fix (same day, pre-merge) — restore both-conditions guard, ledger-complete
    subset only:** the 2nd fix above traded the 8-K false-positive for a new daily-noise bug:
    firing on this-run-retrieval-emptiness ALONE (no producer check at all) means 8-K —
    event-sparse, routinely won't rank top-3 — would fire the receipt on a large fraction of
    normal runs. Redesigned: `COVERAGE_CHECKED_DOC_TYPES` narrowed to `["10-k", "10-q"]` (only the
    types whose `ingested_accessions` producer ledger is COMPLETE — `sec-filings.ts` writes an
    accession row for every 10-K/10-Q ingest; `8-k`'s default-ON summary writer does not, so its
    ledger can't distinguish "no coverage" from "didn't rank today" — excluded;
    `earnings-transcript` stays excluded, no producer anywhere). Restored the BOTH-CONDITIONS gate
    for that subset: `computeEmptyDocTypes` (`src/lib/prompt-safety.ts`) gained a third
    `hasProducerForDocType` predicate parameter — a type is "empty" only when NOT retrieved this
    run AND the predicate reports zero producer rows. Kept `prompt-safety.ts` DB-free:
    `strategy.ts` builds the predicate from ONE bulk `ingestedAccessionCountsByDocType()` call + an
    in-memory prefix lookup (not N per-type queries). Rewrote `test/rag-doc-type-coverage.test.ts`
    (14/14 passing) including the key low-noise case: a 10-K that didn't retrieve this run but HAS
    a producer row must stay silent. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `strategy-prompt-safety`/
    `strategy-rag-quickwins-wiring` sweep 5/5. This is the corpus-truth-then-ledger-scoped redesign
    that shipped — full rationale in the rollout note's new "Second correction" section.

  no production code changed. Added 10 new fixture cases to
  `test/fixtures/rag-retrieval-eval-fixture.ts` covering `EPISODIC_DOC_TYPES`
  (`socratic-decision`/`coach-note`/`lesson`) — the prior 462-line fixture had zero non-filings
  cases, so the harness reportedly saturated at recall 1.0. Each new case has near-miss hard
  negatives (same symbol/regime, wrong thesis or side) so it's actually discriminating. Added two
  `describe` blocks to `test/rag-retrieval-eval.test.ts`: an episodic recall@k/MRR suite (reuses
  the existing scorer via a minimal additive `cases` option on `runFixture`) and a
  single-query-vs-multi-query suite exercising `RetrieveOptions.queries`/`rrfFuse` (#822) directly
  against `retrieveContextDetailed`, asserting no-regression + that the fused pool draws from
  multiple query lists (one `mocks.query` call per fan-out variant). No RAG env flag defaults
  touched. tsc clean; focused `test/rag-retrieval-eval.test.ts` +
  `test/rag-retrieval-regression.test.ts` = 36/36 passing (17 new).
  **2026-07-06 follow-up (2nd commit, pre-merge) — baseline-population + recall-discrimination
  fixes:** the "filings behavior byte-identical" claim above was actually FALSE — the filings
  baseline/rerank/hybrid/as-of `it`s had no `cases` filter and were silently scoring the full
  39-case mix (measured MRR 0.919) instead of the original 29 filings cases (MRR 1.0). Fixed by
  adding `FILINGS_CASES` and wiring it through every filings-only `it`; filings MRR confirmed back
  to 1.0. Also added an explicit `recall1` assertion over the episodic cases (`toBeCloseTo(0.4, 5)`,
  the actual measured value, since recall@3 alone saturates at 1.0 and can't discriminate), and
  replaced a brittle Set+fixed-array-slice assertion in the multi-query plumbing test with a
  no-dupes + all-from-pool check. Still 36/36 passing, tsc clean. Rollout:
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-rag-golden-eval-episodic.md`.
- **PR #970 - Typed retrieval-status receipt (CLAUDE, branch `claude/typed-retrieval-status`).**
  Merged 2026-07-06. Distinguishes no-memory vs lookup-failed vs budget-skipped vs degraded
  instead of every RAG/episodic retrieval outcome collapsing to an indistinguishable `[]`/
  non-empty result. Additive/advisory-only: new `RetrievalStatus` union + optional
  `RetrieveOptions.onStatus` callback wired through the four existing classification points in
  `retrieveContextDetailed` (vector-db.ts), a new `status` field on `ExperienceRetrievalResult`
  (experience-memory.ts), per-symbol/PORTFOLIO capture in strategy.ts persisted via a new
  `rag_retrieval_status` audit row alongside `experience_retrieval`, and an additive optional
  `ragRetrievalStatus` field on `SocraticDecisionCase` (types.ts) — persistence only, no rendering.
  Never gates/alters chunk selection. Coordinated with sibling lane `claude/persist-candidate-pool`
  (also edits `vector-db.ts` `retrieveContextDetailed`) — this diff was kept minimal/localized to
  the early-return points and a thin status output. Tests: `test/rag-retrieval-status.test.ts`
  (new, 11 cases, network-free). Pre-merge Copilot review caught a real bug:
  `retrieveContextDetailedWithStatus`'s forwarding call to a caller-supplied `onStatus` would
  propagate a throwing callback instead of swallowing it (breaking the "throwing callback never
  affects retrieval" contract every other call site relies on) — fixed with a try/catch + a
  regression test. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-typed-retrieval-status.md`.
- **PR #974 - Held-position retrieval scope (CLAUDE, worktree `~/apps/trading-wt-held-scope`,
  branch `claude/held-position-retrieval-scope`).** Merged 2026-07-06. Widens the three retrieval
  scopes in `runStrategyOnce` (filings RAG `topSymbols`, learned-context `learnedSymbols`, episodic
  `situationCandidates`) to UNION in every held (open) position's symbol, not just the score-sorted
  top-N scan candidates — so sell/hold/trim decisions on a held name outside the top slice get
  retrieved memory too (previously zero). Strictly additive: the BUY-candidate scan/prompt set
  (`marketScan.topCandidates`) and its ordering are unchanged; no risk-gate/sizing/policy touch.
  Hoisted the pre-existing `heldSymbols` computation (was locally recomputed for take-profit
  trim-band pruning) to a single shared value. New test:
  `test/strategy-held-position-retrieval-scope.test.ts` (2 tests, held-symbol inclusion + no
  duplicate retrieval + top-N regression). tsc clean, focused strategy/market/learned-context/
  experience-memory suites green. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-held-position-retrieval-scope.md`.
  **Follow-up fix (same day, 2nd commit, pre-merge) — episodic-sketch gap:** episodic
  `buildSituationSketch` (`src/lib/experience-memory.ts`) still did a bare `slice(0, 3)` on
  candidates, so held symbols appended past top-3 reached the `retrieveDecisionExperiences` call
  but were dropped before entering the actual sketch/query text — episodic parity was only
  partial. Fixed with an additive `SituationCandidate.held` flag + a bounded (max 6) held-aware
  selection in `buildSituationSketch`; non-held path is byte-identical to the old slice. 4
  new/strengthened tests across `test/experience-memory.test.ts` +
  `test/strategy-held-position-retrieval-scope.test.ts`; tsc clean; full `npm test` 2678/2678
  passed. Same rollout note, follow-up section appended.
  **Pre-merge Copilot review fix — cross-lane catch-block fallback bug:** with `topSymbols` now
  widened to include `heldSymbols`, the filings-RAG pass could cover more than the original top-3,
  but the typed-retrieval-status lane's (`#970`) fallback in the later `catch` block still only
  added receipt rows for `marketScan.topCandidates.slice(0, 3)` — so a full-pass failure (e.g. a
  vector-db import error) would silently omit held symbols from the `rag_retrieval_status` receipt
  even though they were now in-scope for retrieval. Fixed (commit `23784ad`): the catch-block
  fallback now iterates the same held-widened symbol set (`uniqueSymbols([...top-3,
  ...heldSymbols])`) as the happy path, so a held symbol outside the top-3 still gets a
  `lookup_failed` receipt row if the whole filings-RAG pass throws. (Same review pass also fixed an
  O(heldSymbols × topCandidates) `.find()` loop to O(heldSymbols) via a pre-built symbol→candidate
  map, and corrected a stale code comment on the `SITUATION_SKETCH_MAX_CANDIDATES` cap.)
- **PR #816 - Prompt-safety CR-H: fencing + deterministic injection receipts for the money-path
  prompts (CLAUDE).** Merged to `main` 2026-07-05 as squash `041b73b2` (verify/smoke/gitleaks
  green). Advisory ONLY (owner philosophy: receipts, never blocks): fenced
  `<owner_strategy_prompt>` + one data-not-command clause in the Bull system prompt covering every
  untrusted block (headlines/smartMoney/RAG/learned/analogs/coaching/reflection) + Bear equivalent
  (`STRATEGY_PROMPT_VERSION` 1.4.0→1.5.0); `reflection_summary` moved out of the SYSTEM prompt into
  Bull userContent as fenced `<reflection_summary>` DATA; new leaf `src/lib/prompt-safety.ts`
  deterministic injection scanner → `audit('prompt_injection_suspected')` + kind-`safety`
  decision-case evidence (detection only, never blocks/alters); learned-context lines carry inline
  provenance (`[origin= source= asserted= conf=]`); same-day high-relevance RAG chunk / same-day
  fact → aggregated `audit('evidence_age_anomaly')` + `safety` evidence item; post-mortem
  reflection WRITER fenced at source. Review pass added an excerpt cap on persisted findings (a
  ~50KB base64 blob could otherwise persist unbounded text repeatedly via the decision-case
  evidence JSON) and a fence-escape detection pattern (forged closing tags from inside untrusted
  data). Tests: 2577 total in the full local gate, all green (`test/prompt-safety.test.ts` 31,
  `test/strategy-prompt-safety.test.ts` 4, plus focused strategy/chat/socratic/learned-context
  suites). See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-05-prompt-safety-fencing.md`.
- **PR #819 - Wire `usage-budget` Phase 2 (advisory-first, owner-overridable enforcement) into
  `runStrategyOnce` (CLAUDE).** Merged to `main` 2026-07-05 as squash `f28322fe`
  (verify/smoke/gitleaks green). ADVISORY (always on when the monitor is configured):
  `usage_budget_status` audit receipt every run + a `formatBudgetAdvisory` line injected into the
  Bull userContent next to `drawdownAdvisory`. ENFORCEMENT (opt-in via `USAGE_BUDGET_ENFORCE`,
  default off) at the per-user/day LLM budget choke point: skip ends the run before any LLM call
  (audit + `notifyBudgetSkip`); downgrade swaps `policy.llmModel`/`redTeamLlmModel` on the
  in-memory run policy only, never persisted. `debateProposal` gained an optional `policyOverride`
  param so the Bear picks up the same transient downgrade. **Adversarial review caught a BLOCKER
  pre-merge:** the enforcement block was mutating the shared `policy` object in place, so a
  same-run cap-breach demotion's `setPolicy({ ...policy, strategyAuthority: "propose" })` would
  have persisted the downgraded models to the DB permanently, contradicting the "never persisted"
  contract; fixed with a separately-carried `runLlmOverride`/`runPolicy` never passed to
  `setPolicy`/`autoRevertOnCapBreach`, plus a regression test that trips both a downgrade and a
  cap-breach demotion in the same run. Also fixed: scoped the enforcement try/catch so a post-audit
  throw in the skip path can't be swallowed into the full LLM path; threaded the downgrade into
  `generateReflectionSummary` (outcome-engine lesson pass left as a documented intentional
  exemption — fire-and-forget, outlives the run); de-duplicated the budget-status fetch; extended
  the downgrade test to assert the Red Team request body's model too. Full local gate: 2587 tests
  across 261 files, all green; build clean. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-05-usage-budget-advisory-wiring.md`.
- **PR #820 - Durable due-jobs substrate for 15m/1h intraday outcome sampling (CLAUDE).** Merged to
  `main` 2026-07-05 as squash `e90db1a8` (verify/smoke/gitleaks green). New `due_jobs` table
  (migration v11) + `src/lib/db-jobs.ts` (lease/reclaim claimable queue — fixes the
  crashed-row-stuck-forever gap the existing `mobile_commands` queue has). `counterfactual-learning.ts`
  + `outcome-engine.ts`'s `measureCase` enqueue `sample_intraday_horizon` jobs once a case's basis
  (fill or ref price) resolves; new `drainDueIntradaySampleJobs` worker drains them through the same
  `mergeHorizonRows`/write path the existing inline `samplableNow` path uses (belt-and-suspenders,
  no duplicate rows); one fire-and-forget call added to `scheduler.ts`'s `tick()`. **Adversarial
  review caught a lost-update-race BLOCKER pre-merge:** `measureCase` held an outcomes snapshot
  across awaits, so its wholesale write could erase a 15m/1h row the due-jobs worker had already
  persisted concurrently; fixed by re-merging against a fresh DB read immediately before every
  terminal/partial write (`writeSocraticDecisionOutcome`, `markSkippedCounterfactualMatured`,
  `markSkippedCounterfactualUnresolvable`). Also fixed: claimant-fenced the three terminal-transition
  functions in `db-jobs.ts` (a stale/lease-expired worker could otherwise resurrect an
  already-completed job); renamed the drain receipt's `failed` counter to `erroredRetried` +
  removed the dead `'failed'` `DueJobStatus` value; replaced the worker's `caseId.split(":")`
  counterfactual lookup with an exact `runId`/`horizonDays`-keyed lookup (the split-based lookup
  could silently match the wrong row when a run/symbol pair had more than one horizon-day config);
  added `due_jobs` to the account-deletion drift guard. Full local gate green (2529+/2530+ full
  suite, build clean). See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-05-durable-due-jobs.md`.
- **PR #822 - HyDE + evidence-derived multi-query retrieval for filings RAG, flag-gated (CLAUDE).**
  Merged to `main` 2026-07-05 as squash `d97b7c71` (verify/smoke/gitleaks green). New
  `src/lib/rag/multi-query.ts`: pure `deriveQueryVariants()` (2-4 facet sub-queries from
  evidence/sector/dominant-factor) + `generateHydePassages()` (one cheap fail-open LLM call, HyDE
  passages). Two flags `RAG_MULTIQUERY`/`RAG_HYDE` (+`RAG_HYDE_MODEL`), both **default OFF** —
  byte-identical retrieval when both are off (pinned by a dedicated regression test); not
  independent, `RAG_HYDE` alone is a no-op without `RAG_MULTIQUERY`. `vector-db.ts`
  `RetrieveOptions.queries?: string[]`: per-query embed+match (including the original query
  alongside variants), RRF-fused into the existing `rankPool` pipeline unchanged. **Adversarial
  review caught a fail-CLOSED BLOCKER pre-merge:** the multi-query fan-out had no per-item catch,
  so one variant's rejected Voyage/Pinecone call discarded every other variant's already-successful
  results via a bare `Promise.all`, returning empty filings context instead of falling back to the
  single-query path; fixed so each fan-out call is caught individually and an all-fail case falls
  back to plain single-query retrieval (flags-off behavior). Also fixed: first-occurrence-wins id
  resolution could keep a lower cosine score (now higher-score wins); HyDE's endpoint/model could
  disagree (could route an OpenAI model id to `api.anthropic.com` under an Anthropic policy,
  silently returning `[]`; now resolved coherently with an audit on non-OK responses); HyDE spend
  wasn't gated on the daily LLM budget (now gated via `isOverLlmBudget`). Full local gate: 2619
  tests across 264 files, all green; build clean. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-05-hyde-multiquery-retrieval.md`.

  block is a light preference the agent may self-override with a logged `autonomyOverride` thesis.
  Inverted the Socratic override classifier from an allowlist to a DENYLIST: new
  `HARD_GATE_REASON_PATTERNS` + `isHardGateReason` source-of-truth in `policy.ts` (risk engine);
  `socratic-runtime.ts` `overrideableReason` = `!isHardGateReason`. Reclassified short-stop-required

  default overridable instead of silently hard. Advisory-only (nothing auto-overrides;

  the full matrix. Cross-lane touch to `socratic-runtime.ts` (CLAUDE's file) coordinated

  reserved this site "for the risk lane (Monet)" is now resolved), and the escalation gate
  (`regime-watch.ts` `isEscalationRegime`, also feeding the dissent trigger). The "one-line adoption"
  w1-regime-data (#368) exported the typed predicates + pinned `test/market-regime.test.ts` for.
  Correctness hardening only — canonical-label behavior byte-identical (incl. the Cautious-Inverted
  asymmetry); non-canonical free-text labels now read non-escalating instead of accidentally
  substring-matching. Imports `./market-regime` (not `./macro`) to survive the whole-module macro mock
  in `test/regime-watch.test.ts`. New gate-level regression `test/regime-gate-adoption.test.ts` + a
  `policy.test.ts` hardening case. Gate green: tsc/lint-0/2465 tests/build. KEEPOUT respected: no
  mem/RAG (CLAUDE) or console/UI (CODEX) files touched. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-04-regime-enum-risk-gate-adoption.md`.

- **PR #374 - GitHub Issues mirror of the effort board (Claude, sonnet lane), cross-app.**
  Merged 2026-07-04. Additive, read-only owner-visibility layer over docs/EFFORT-LOG.md: boards
  stay the single source of truth, agents never write issues — a new workflow reconciles them.
  scripts/sync-effort-issues.py (python3 stdlib, no deps) parses the board (keyword-classified
  sections tolerant of heading/emoji drift, top-level bullets as items, SHA1-of-first-line
  identity marker for idempotent re-runs); Planned/Completed -> issue open
  (effort-board + state:planned|state:in-progress, assigned jaywedgeworth22 for mobile
  notifications), Completed/Deployed -> issue closed. New .github/workflows/effort-issues-sync.yml
  (push to main touching the board file, daily off-minute cron, workflow_dispatch). Rolled out
  identically to congress-trading-shared (PR #4) and API-usage-monitor (PR #9); protocol doc
  (/Users/jay/apps/EFFORT-LOG-PROTOCOL.md) gained an "Issues mirror (standard)" subsection +
  bootstrap-checklist update. Verified: parser tested against all three repos' real boards before
  rollout; a genuine duplicate board row (this repo's own "Wave-1 quick wins..." logged twice
  under Completed) was caught by a live dry-run and fixed with in-run dedup; full quartet green;
  post-merge first sync created 58 Socratic.Trade issues (32 completed/6 deployed closed, 9
  in-progress/11 planned open), 2 open issues in congress-trading-shared, 3 open issues in
  API-usage-monitor — all confirmed via the Issues API. See
  docs/rollouts/2026-07-04-effort-issues-mirror.md.
- **PR #371 - Fleet-wide Sentry observability (Claude, sonnet lane).** Merged 2026-07-04
  (`120968725f7e58f383917aafe5c63ec8cfcd10d0`), CI `verify` green. Sentry project `fleet-infra`
  (org jays-services). (a) `/Users/jay/apps/fleet-sentry-monitor/monitor.py` registered under pm2
  (`fleet-sentry-monitor`, `pm2 save`d, machine-side, not in this repo) — pm2 crash-loop (restart
  delta >= 5/interval, hourly-deduped fingerprints) + down detection (error for
  `trading`/`trading-main`, warning otherwise), disk free (<20GB warn/<8GB error) + known SQLite
  WAL >512MB warning, Claude.app presence/RSS (context only), `gh api rate_limit` <300 remaining
  warning, self-hosted runner status (context only), self check-in to Sentry Crons monitor
  `fleet-host-monitor` (interval 2min, margin 5, max_runtime 2, America/Chicago). Verified: two
  live pm2-driven passes completed check-ins ("ok"), a synthetic restart-delta test correctly
  fired the crash-loop error, and the real `gh` rate-limit warning fired live (fleet burned
  graphql to 0 during testing). Note: another agent has since continued iterating on
  `monitor.py` in place (adding per-app agent/app tags, Codex session breadcrumbs) — see the
  Codex coordination row above; this is expected concurrent enhancement of the same singleton,
  not a regression of this PR's scope. (b) `.github/workflows/sentry-ci-report.yml` +
  `scripts/sentry-ci-report.py`, ADDITIVE ONLY (zero edits to any pre-existing workflow): on
  `workflow_run: types:[completed]` across all 7 workflows that existed at authoring time (CI,
  Codex Autofix, Deploy, Sync Preview Lanes, Shared package pin check, Playwright Smoke,
  Security) — failure conclusion -> raw-envelope Sentry error event {workflow, branch, actor}
  fingerprinted [workflow, branch]; schedule-triggered runs -> Sentry Crons check-in mirroring
  that workflow's own cron (slugs `ci-security`, `ci-playwright-smoke`,
  `ci-shared-package-pin-check`). Repo secret `SENTRY_FLEET_DSN` set via `gh secret set` (value
  never echoed). Locally dry-ran the reporter script against the real DSN before pushing — both
  envelope POSTs returned HTTP 200. Landed via `scripts/land.sh` (merged `origin/main`'s
  concurrently-merged PR #370 cleanly first) + `gh pr merge --squash --auto`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-04-fleet-sentry-observability.md`.

## Completed
- **App-wide Audit: Draining State and Cap Fixes (Antigravity/AG, branch `codex/app-wide-audit-20260711`) — COMPLETED 2026-07-12.** Fixed account-deletion race conditions by introducing a safe `is_draining` state and cascade cleanup (`purgeConnectedAccount`). Fixed daily notional risk tracking to accurately attribute to `placed_at` instead of `created_at`, covering `placing` intents as well. Updated various tests, SEC time-flakiness, and local dev forwarded-host behaviors. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-12-app-wide-audit-draining-fixes.md`.
- **Consolidate usage telemetry clients in consumer apps (AG) — ✅ COMPLETED 2026-07-06 (PR #1005).** Replaced `postBatch` telemetry sending logic with `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared` in Socratic.Trade.
- **Fix mobile "Settings" crash inside Sheet (AG, S)** — Fixed "Maximum call stack size exceeded" bug caused by a focus trap race condition when navigating to settings from the More sheet menu on mobile. PR pending.

- **CLAUDE next-wave: RAG retrieval-quality + corpus-integrity cluster (CLAUDE) — COMPLETED 2026-07-06: ALL 5 lanes MERGED to main.** Follows the merged+deployed CLAUDE train (#816/#819/#820/#822 → prod `7b5450fe`). Triage-first (9-row read-only pass found 3 already-done: as-of-strict, train/serve embed skew, verify-reindex; 1 deferred: server-side numeric as-of Pinecone filter — needs an ingest-epoch backfill + fail-mode owner decision), then 5 lanes built → adversarial-reviewed → fixed → sequentially landed:
  **#970** typed-retrieval-status (typed ok/no_memory/lookup_failed/budget_skipped/degraded receipt, advisory, byte-identical for existing callers); **#973** rag-golden-eval-episodic (episodic/analog + hard-negative eval cases + single-vs-multi-query #822 comparison, test-only); **#974** held-position-retrieval-scope (held/open-position symbols now get filings-RAG + learned-context + episodic retrieval, incl. the sketch); **#977** corpus-coverage-receipt (advisory receipt when a producible filings doc type has zero corpus, both-conditions on 10-k/10-q where the ingest ledger is complete; 8-k/earnings-transcript excluded to avoid daily noise); **#979** persist-candidate-pool (flag-gated default-OFF persistence of the post-rankPool candidate pool incl. unused, honest about not capturing upstream drops — v2 pre-rankPool follow-up noted). Adversarial review caught 1 real BLOCKER (corpus-coverage would have false-fired 8-k daily) + a cross-lane bug (held-scope symbols omitted from #970's catch-block fallback) + several nits, all fixed before merge. KEEPOUT respected (no MONET risk-gate / CODEX console / AG data-provider files). Per-lane rollout notes under docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-*. Deferred/owner-decision: server-side as-of Pinecone filter; persist-pool v2 (pre-rankPool drop capture).
- **Codex autofix storm guard (CODEX, workflow/fleet-infra) — DONE-local 2026-07-05; awaiting push/PR.**
  Scope: reduce `codex-autofix.yml` storm odds/frequency by running the autofix loop once per
  Codex submitted review plus manual `workflow_dispatch`, not on every Codex inline/issue
  comment. Touch workflow callers only in clean Codex worktrees; preserve manual dispatch and
  round-cap behavior.

- **Harden HMAC Security & Persistent Idempotency for webhooks (AG, M) — moved back from Completed
  2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3).** PR #854 (`antigravity/socratic-webhooks`) is OPEN,
  mergeStateStatus BLOCKED, all CI green, reviewDecision empty, no auto-merge armed. Blocked by the
  main-protection ruleset needing review/thread-resolution — not a code issue. action=land-it; see
  the new "Resolve main-protection ruleset review gate" Planned row below for the structural fix.

- **Congress.Trade Improvements (AG, M)** — Comprehensive improvements across UI, data sharing, and scraping. Worktree `~/apps/trading-antigravity`, branch `agent/antigravity`.
  1. [x] **UI/UX Mobile Refactor**: Implement responsive cards/scroll for data tables in `dashboardHtml.ts`.
  2. [ ] **Shared Ticker Aliases**: Move ticker alias resolution logic into `congress-trading-shared`.
  3. [ ] **Typed API Client SDK**: Build and export a strongly-typed `CongressTradeClient` in the shared repo.
  4. [ ] **Senate Scraper Handshake**: Implement Cloudflare KV session caching for the Senate eFD agreement gate.
- **MONET 5 risk lanes — SUPERSEDED / ALREADY COMPLETED 2026-07-05 (CORRECTION).** All five lanes were already implemented + merged by CONCURRENT sessions while a MONET session was mid-build: **#875** redteam policy-aware routing (`7b5450fe`, prod-deployed 2026-07-06), **#881** multi-signal regime severity scorer, **#883** vol-targeting + portfolio-heat, **#945** fractional-Kelly, **#879** correlation + blackout + stress — all on `main`. This reclaim was too late; the MONET session's lane-1 (regime-severity) rebuild was a byte-different DUPLICATE of #881 and was ABANDONED unpushed (land.sh stale-overlap guard caught it before any push). No further action — MONET risk-lane work is DONE. Original (now moot) reclaim text follows. The five risk rows handed back to MONET (board "MONET risk-row handback"): `monet/multi-signal-regime-scorer` (credit spreads + VIX term structure + breadth → severity), `monet/vol-targeting-portfolio-heat` (continuous vol-target exposure taper + portfolio-heat budget), `monet/correlation-event-stress-gates` (EWMA/downside correlation gate + earnings/macro blackouts + pre-trade stress), `monet/fractional-kelly-sizing` (downside-dispersion fractional Kelly), `monet/redteam-policy-aware-routing` (Red-Team unavailable → policy-aware routing timeout/429/malformed; builds on merged #814). All advisory/owner-overridable (never a cage), new-module-first (minimal policy.ts/strategy.ts diffs), built off current `main` on `monet/*` branches (the old empty `.claude/worktrees/monet-*` `claude/*` branches are NOT reused). Running a 5-lane design team, then implementing lane-by-lane with builder + adversarial verify, one PR per lane via `land.sh`. The old CLAUDE-pickup "Risk-lane implementation train" row below is superseded by this handback reclaim.

- **Codex Cloud Slack + effort-log readiness across all four apps (CODEX, shared fleet-infra) —
  DONE-local 2026-07-05; awaiting owner approval to push/open PRs.** Scope: audit/standardize Codex Cloud repo-visible setup so remote
  Codex sessions can read `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` and use #agent-sync with the configured
  `SLACK_AGENT_NAME`, `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`, `SLACK_PROJECT`, and runtime token/env settings. Keep
  work out of dirty Cursor/Monet worktrees; reuse/adapt the closed PR #367 Slack helper rather than
  creating a competing Slack Socket Mode client. Cross-app rows mirrored in the other live boards.
- ~~**PR #808 - Cursor session: P0 checkRegimeFlip RMW fix + P1 backlog exhaustiveness (CURSOR)**~~
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3): MOVED TO COMPLETED — origin-verified #844 (squash `ebcf6a23`) is
  merged to `main`, confirmed containing the P0 per-user regime keys, security headers, and
  LLM_SPEND_CEILING. Full history relocated to the Completed section under "PR #844 -
  pr805-remediation" (see there); this Completed placeholder kept only as a pointer per
  never-delete-a-row._

- **Design-sync: Socratic Trade UI Kit -> claude.ai/design (CLAUDE) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-05, PR open.** Branch `agent/design-sync-uikit`, isolated worktree off `origin/main` (primary worktree was busy with a live Cursor session). 30 app primitives (12 `ui` + 18 `console`, from `app/ui/primitives.tsx` + `app/console/ui/primitives.tsx`) converted + uploaded to claude.ai/design so the design agent builds with the real components. Render check 30/30 clean, conventions header shipped. Uploaded to 2 owner accounts (projects `0a962679…`, `1da8546c…`). Additive only: `.design-sync/` inputs + one `.gitignore` block, no app source changed. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-05-design-sync-uikit.md`.

  earnings-blackout + pre-trade stress advisory receipts (`59367732`). **#881** multi-signal regime-severity
  scorer (`d3ce537a`). Plus **#877** — a fleet-wide `socratic-db` CI-flake fix (deterministic ORDER BY
  tiebreaker, `fc4b179e`) that had been intermittently failing `verify` on every open PR. All 5 risk lanes
  advisory/owner-overridable behind default-OFF `policy.tuning.*` flags (byte-identical when off), each with
  its own `docs/rollouts/` note. Pipeline: 6-reader parallel risk-engine map → 5 lane specs → sonnet builders
  + 2 adversarial reviewers (spec + correctness) per lane + bounded fix pass — caught 3 real money-path issues
  the green suite missed (redteam de-risk-exit hold relaxed on-by-default → gated OFF; corrstress
  proposal-identity break in the `requiresHumanReview` Set via object-spread; regime severity computed
  unconditionally → gated OFF) → serial land via land.sh with origin/main merge-conflict resolution
  (strategy.ts/types.ts, incl. applyDeterministicSizing signature/param-order reconciliation with #850's
  `prefetched` and #814's advisory-veto machinery) + Copilot/Codex review-thread resolution (12 threads
  addressed with code, never blind-resolved). Keepouts respected (CODEX console/UI, CLAUDE mem/RAG +
  test-determinism files, AG health-routing, cursor session). CLAUDE seat (AGENT_SEAT-pinned). Supersedes the
  MONET risk-lanes-handback row above — no monet/* branches or PRs ever reached origin for these lanes.

- **Shared-dep tokenless git-dependency switch (CLAUDE, resumed worker) — CLOSED, superseded by #444.**
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE next-wave): CORRECTION — `origin/main` already pins
  `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared` to `git+https://...#v1.2.0` and
  `scripts/npm-ci-with-shared-deps.sh` is deleted from `main` (landed via the #444 hardening path —
  see the "tokenless public HTTPS `congress-trading-shared` dependency path" Deployed-section rows
  above, PR #444). This row's separately-claimed `claude/tokenless-git-dep` lane (below, under
  Planned/Reserved — worktree `/Users/jay/apps/trading-wt-tokenless-dep`) is therefore also
  superseded; reclaim that worktree and delete `origin/claude/tokenless-git-dep`. Original text
  (retroactive claim 2026-07-04; collision with codex/shared-dep-https-hardening resolved via
  sync-26: Codex hardening reqs folded in — explicit git+https pinned tag + no-SSH npm-ci proof)

- **Codex global coordination + fleet monitoring setup (Codex, shared `/Users/jay/apps`
  infra) — 2026-07-04.** Scope: make Codex follow the canonical `#agent-sync` +
  effort-log protocol across current/future repos, add missing bootstrap/audit
  tooling, and extend the singleton `fleet-sentry-monitor` with Codex-specific
  breadcrumbs/warnings instead of creating a duplicate monitor. Collision notes:
  do not touch Monet PR #367's repo Slack engine; do not duplicate Claude's
  `fleet-sentry-monitor` / `sentry-ci-report.yml` singleton lanes. Current state:
  `.secrets` bot-token Slack posting verified, Codex host/session breadcrumbs
  added to the singleton monitor, stale Codex OTLP config removed from
  `~/.codex/config.toml`, and Congress.Trade docs-only PR #137 opened with green
  checks.
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE next-wave): status update — this row predates 2026-07-05's biggest
  machine-side infra changes (the `agent-sync-push` Socket Mode daemon, the tunnel `/post`
  endpoint, and `consumer.mjs`). That work shipped with NO board reservation at all — there was no
  fleet-infra board despite `AGENT-SYNC.md` defining a `fleet-infra` repo tag. Per the fleet-infra
  next-wave spec, a `/Users/jay/apps/FLEET-INFRA-EFFORT-LOG.md` board is being bootstrapped
  (separately, not mirrored into this repo) to backfill that work as rows and give future
  machine-side infra a reservation surface. Current relay state as of 2026-07-05: `agent-sync-push`
  connects to Slack Socket Mode successfully (hello observed in logs) but **zero events are
  delivered** — Slack Event Subscriptions (message.channels) is not yet enabled on the app side
  (owner action pending), so `/Users/jay/apps/agent-sync/events.jsonl` does not exist yet and
  `consumer.mjs`-based reads are currently silent/inert; the legacy 20s `poller.py` Slack-API loop
  remains the working fallback read path until Event Subscriptions is toggled on._

- **`claude/ci-hybrid-runner-verify` (Claude, worktree `~/apps/trading-wt-ci-efficiency`) —
  moved from Planned 2026-07-04 after PR #370 merged.** Hybrid resource-aware runner routing for
  the required `verify` check (owner re-confirmed with design; verbatim intent: "hybrid so that
  it only uses local when there is sufficient extra CPU/RAM available"). ci.yml 2 jobs -> 4:
  classify (+route output; self only for fresh <5 min publisher state on same-repo
  pull_request/push, everything else hosted), verify-self (macOS lane: [self-hosted,
  trading-live], timeout 30, concurrency-1, guard, node fail-fast, nice -n 19, macOS cache
  namespace), verify-hosted (Linux lane: routed-hosted + exactly-one auto re-run when self did
  not succeed; saves Linux .next cache on main pushes AND nightly schedule), verify (REQUIRED
  check, pure gate: fail-closed on classify failure, hosted wins on disagreement — Linux
  arbiter, per-run environment annotation). Nightly hosted canary cron. New owner-run
  scripts/runner-availability.sh (ASCII, bash-3.2-verified) publishes VERIFY_RUNNER_STATE every
  60s (load<0.6/cpu, RAM>6GB free+inactive, runner alive, pm2 trading online; 2-check
  hysteresis to self, instant hosted on busy, EXIT-trap hosted). Repo var pre-created
  {"mode":"hosted","ts":0} — merging changes nothing until the owner starts the publisher (pm2
  one-liner in docs/rollouts/2026-07-04-ci-hybrid-runner-verify.md, which carries the full
  history/objections/re-confirmation + gate decision table + failure-mode table). STATUS:
  implemented, verification green (yaml-lint, bash 3.2 -n + ASCII, 8-case route test, read-only
  Mac probes, local quartet), PR #372 open, auto-merge armed.
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE next-wave): CORRECTION — PR #372's mergeable state is **CONFLICTING**; armed
  auto-merge can never fire while it stays conflicting. Stalled since 2026-07-04. Needs a
  merge-forward of `origin/main` (absorbing the ci.yml churn from #370/#799/#812/etc. since #372
  was opened) before it can land — plus the owner still hasn't started the
  `scripts/runner-availability.sh` publisher this design depends on (a separate, non-blocking
  prerequisite for the routing to do anything once merged)._
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3): re-verified — still OPEN, mergeStateStatus DIRTY, mergeable
  CONFLICTING; auto-merge is armed but cannot fire while conflicting. `git merge-tree` shows real
  conflicts in `ci.yml`/`STATUS.md`/`docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` vs current main. No commits since
  2026-07-04; 8 commits ahead of main. All CI checks green — the block is purely the stale conflict.
  action=reclaim-and-finish; see the new "Rebase/merge-forward PR #372" Planned row below._

- **`claude/drawdown-advisory-rescope` (Monet, cloud — risk swimlane) → PR #360, auto-merge armed.**
  `drawdownBreakerAction = "advisory"|"close_only"|"halt"`, default advisory: breach → receipt +
  `drawdownAdvisory` block in strategist context, NO systemState flip; halt/close_only explicit
  opt-in. Reverts #343's hard-halt default. Gates green (tsc/lint 0/2375 tests/build).
  Follow-on (Monet): adopt the typed regime enum inside breaker/crisis-cap/bear-filter after
  Fable's w1-regime-data hits main. _(Row mirrored by Fable — Monet is cloud-side and cannot
  write this board directly; repo docs/EFFORT-LOG.md carries Monet's own copy.)_

- Wave-1 quick wins from the composite expert review (Claude coordinator, 4 Sonnet lanes, push-only branches; landed via the 2026-07-04 landing train — Fable operator):
  - `claude/w1-llm-fixes` — Bear schema confidenceScore fix (live bug); non-OpenAI reasoning-token headroom; cross-family Bear default + temperature; reward-abstention; stakes-scaled dissent trigger. STATUS: **MERGED (PR #364)**.
  - `claude/w1-learning-loops` — Bear-veto counterfactuals + red-team efficacy scorecard; re-index decision memory on lifecycle changes; trading-day horizon arithmetic; + Codex second-pass review fixes (market-day horizon anchoring via new `market-calendar.marketDateOf`, kind-scoped veto audit queries + keyed efficacy joins, NULL-evidence backfill on `insertSkippedCounterfactualCandidate`). STATUS: **MERGED (PR #365)**. `getRedTeamEfficacy()` remains API/db-level only (console lane owns UI wiring). Deferred: `skipped_candidate_counterfactuals` has no `side` column, so vetoed SHORTs still read as long moves in the GENERIC missed-opportunity path (efficacy path side-adjusts) — candidate for the w2-outcome-engine lane's schema pass.
  - `claude/w1-rag-quickwins` — relevance floor + near-dup dedupe wired; provenance headers + stable chunk ids; content-hash dedup on + 128-bit; embedding-model version tag; rerank pool cap. STATUS: **MERGED (PR #366)**.
  - `claude/w1-regime-data` — typed regime enum + numeric severity (new dependency-free `src/lib/market-regime.ts`); live ^VIX off the 24h macro cache; per-data-class TTLs + asOf on Alpaca snapshot. STATUS: **MERGED (PR #368)**. NOTE (correction to the earlier row text): the crisis cap (policy.ts) and bear filter (strategy.ts) deliberately KEPT their substring checks per the Fable/Monet swimlane keepout — enum adoption inside risk gates is Monet's (#360 landed with them intact); only the console regime card adopted the enum.

- 2026-07-04 landing train (Fable operator) — also landed: `claude/console-small-fixes` (**PR #361**), `claude/washsale-advisory-defaults` (**PR #362**), `claude/socratic-expert-review-doc` (**PR #363**), `claude/agent-sync-protocol-docs` (**PR #369**). Wave-2 lanes landed sequentially: `w2-episodic-retrieval` (**PR #437, merged 2026-07-04T21:05:02Z**), `w2-outcome-engine` (merged, see the corrected sub-lane rows above), `w2-coaching-durable`, `w2-reflection-decompose`. _(2026-07-05 CLAUDE next-wave correction: this line said "PR #437 in flight"; #437 has since merged. `w2-coaching-durable`/`w2-reflection-decompose` remain the two genuinely unlanded sub-lanes — no PR opened for either since 07-04.)_

- **`claude/tokenless-git-dep` (Claude, worktree `/Users/jay/apps/trading-wt-tokenless-dep`) —
  2026-07-04, cross-repo effort resuming a died-mid-task lane.** `congress-trading-shared` is
  now public; owner-directed switch from the private GitHub Packages registry
  (`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` auth) to a tokenless git dependency. Shared repo's prep work
  (`claude/tokenless-git-dep-prep`) was found ALREADY MERGED (PR #7) with tag `v1.2.0`
  already cut before this session started — see
  `/Users/jay/apps/CONGRESS-SHARED-EFFORT-LOG.md`. This row covers the Socratic.Trade
  consumer switch: `package.json` -> `github:jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared#semver:^1.2.x`,
  dropped `.npmrc`, regenerated lockfile tokenlessly (proven: clean `npm ci` with
  `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` unset and `GIT_SSH_COMMAND=/bin/false`), removed
  `scripts/npm-ci-with-shared-deps.sh` and its call sites in `ci.yml`/`deploy.yml`/`e2e.yml`/
  `codex-autofix.yml`/`sync-previews.yml`/`scripts/sync-preview-lanes.sh`/`scripts/cloud-setup.sh`.
  Coordination note: PR #372 (`claude/ci-hybrid-runner-verify`) is open and also touches
  `ci.yml` — this branch merges `origin/main` before landing and keeps both changes if #372
  lands first. Congress.Trade gets its own PR (separate repo, separate AGENTS.md rules).
  STATUS: gates green locally (lint 0 errors, tsc clean, 2449 tests, build ok); opening PR next.

Immediate acquisition, TTL heartbeat, persisted-owner revalidation/cooperative loss cancellation, and owner-checked release close process/deploy overlap; every non-forced path rechecks cadence after acquisition. Admin claims precede rate debit and pass an opaque capability for core reuse; background busy results do no network/marker work and admin routes use the shared-v1.5 409 adapter. `scheduler.ts` is untouched; detached `refreshEightK` embedding remains a documented follow-up. Adversarial review fixed stale-owner success, omitted route-harness coverage, and temp-DB isolation. The first full build caught a `node:crypto` Edge trace; Web Crypto fixed it.

- **Tradier broker adapter — fifth broker (CLAUDE subagent, branch `claude/tradier-broker`) —
  IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10 (tradier-broker workflow); gates green locally, PR opening.** Adds
  Tradier as a fifth BrokerGateway by mirroring the Alpaca adapter against Tradier's hand-rolled
  REST (single Bearer token, no SDK): new `src/lib/tradier.ts` (all 9 methods), `"tradier"` added
  to the `ConnectedAccount.broker` + `TradingPolicy.activeBroker` closed unions, factory switch in
  `broker.ts` (inherits the `withLivePreflight` live-order choke point for free), `broker-side.ts`
  + `broker-held-orders.ts` state-vocab additions (`error` terminal-decline, `pending` resting),
  connect API + settings UI (single Access-Token sheet, explicit Sandbox/Production selector — no
  PK/PA inference), and labels across execution-mode/dashboard/chrome/strategy. Whole-share only
  (`fractional:false`, floor-or-throw), DIRECT 4-value side map (buy/sell/sell_short/buy_to_cover,
  not `toBrokerSide`), synthetic stops (no OTOCO — strategy gates broker brackets to Alpaca).
  Environment derives the base URL (sandbox.tradier.com vs api.tradier.com) so the two venues can
  never cross. New `test/tradier.test.ts` + extended route/execution-mode/broker-side tests. Node24
  gate: tsc clean, eslint 0-err, full suite green, build clean. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-tradier-broker.md`. Follow-ups (openQuestions): native OTOCO brackets,
  the real preview endpoint for `reviewEquityOrder`, IRA agentic-allowed decision, orders
  pagination field confirmation, and an optional operator env-token tier.
  **Adversarial-review fixups (2026-07-10, second pass, gates green node24): 7 confirmed findings
  fixed, each with a regression test — (1) HIGH symbol canonicalization: positions/orders/quotes now
  all hyphenate share-class tickers to BRK-B via fromTradierSymbol/toTradierSymbol so a position
  matches its own orders; (2) market dollar orders size from a FRESH quote not the stale
  referencePrice (throw if no live quote); (3) environment is the base-URL authority — gateway ignores
  + connect route rejects a host-mismatched Tradier baseUrl (paper never routes to api.tradier.com);
  (4) dollar-sizing quote lookup key aligned to #1; (5) synthetic-stop refId kept in the portable
  [A-Za-z0-9-] charset so the Tradier tag round-trips the client-order-id dedup for u_<hash> users;
  (6) access-token field masked (type=password); (7) cancel normalizes raw 'ok' -> 'pending_cancel'.
  Not merged. Tradier tag charset not re-confirmable from live SPA docs — fix is charset-independent.**
  **Fixups round 2 — codex-autofix (9dd5f40c) reconciliation (CLAUDE, 2026-07-11, gates green node24;
  updates PR #1380, NOT merged): the `[codex-autofix]` commit's equity-class order filter + PDT
  buying-power read introduced two money-path regressions, now fixed with regression tests. (1) MEDIUM
  double-sell: getEquityOrders pagination broke on the post-filter count, so an option-only page could
  stop the loop before a later page's resting protective EQUITY exit — hiding it from
  liveExitOrderCoverage and letting the synthetic monitor place a duplicate; continuation now decided on
  the RAW page (any new id of any class), equity filter applied only to returns, 50-page cap + dedup
  kept. (2) LOW: surface EQUITY legs of OTOCO/OCO/OTO containers (new equityRowsFromTradierOrder) so a
  user-placed Tradier bracket's stop leg is visible to coverage — leg field shape NEEDS LIVE-TOKEN
  CONFIRMATION. (3) LOW: getPortfolio no longer feeds the ~4x intraday pdt.stock_buying_power into
  sizing — takes the conservative min of the POSITIVE Reg-T/PDT figures (literal 0 treated as absent).
  (4) INFO: brokerPortableRefId gains a 255-char cap matching Tradier's sanitizeTag. No Alpaca/Robinhood/
  test-broker behavior changed. See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-tradier-broker.md` "Fixups round 2".
  ROUND 3 (2026-07-10, CLAUDE subagent, updates PR #1380, NOT merged): closed a LOW residual left by
  round 2's fix (3) — the conservative-min was SYMMETRIC, so an absent/zero Reg-T OVERNIGHT
  stock_buying_power with a positive ~4x INTRADAY pdt.stock_buying_power made min() return the INTRADAY
  figure as buying power (silent overnight lever-up, contra owner's NAV-caps+opt-in-leverage decision).
  Fix: the intraday figure is now a DOWNWARD-ONLY clamp on the overnight base; absent/zero overnight =>
  buying power UNKNOWN (0, which strategy.ts/policy.ts both read as "don't block, defer to broker" — like
  Alpaca's missing buying_power). +2 regression tests (45 tradier tests). Rollout note gained a
  "Pre-live-token validation items" section for the OTOCO leg-`class` shape + 50-page-cap ordering
  residuals (both need a live sandbox token). See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-tradier-broker.md` "Round 3".**
- **FMP request-quota wiring — extend the unified quota to FMP (CLAUDE, branch
  `claude/fmp-rate-limit`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10, PR open.** FMP was the last high-volume
  enrichment provider NOT metered by the unified quota (PR #1310): `FmpEnrichmentProvider.enrich`
  fires up to 5 HTTP calls per miss symbol (insider + senate always; ratios-ttm/grades-consensus/
  price-target-consensus when not skipped) under the single `fmp` circuit-breaker service, bounded
  only by `FMP_MAX_SYMBOLS`, so a cold-cache scan could burst past FMP Starter's 300/min. Added
  `fmp: [{290, MINUTE}]` to `RATE_QUOTAS` (290 = 300 minus headroom; NO day window by default —
  `PROVIDER_QUOTA_FMP_PER_DAY` opts one in for the free 250/day tier); widened `callsPerSymbol` with
  an `fmp` case (`2 + !skipPe + !skipConsensus + wantTargets`, range 2..5) mirroring the fetch
  conditions one-for-one; wired admit/greedy-best-first-defer/partial-remainder-refund + breaker-skip
  refund into `enrich` (exactly the tiingo shape, per-credential lane via `apiKeyFingerprint`); set
  `retries: 0` on FMP `getJson` so a 429 retry can't emit an uncounted call past the 10-request
  headroom. Reservation == dispatch (both read the same `skipFlagsFor` + `wantTargets`); cache hits
  and deferred symbols spend nothing. Docs: `.env.example` FMP block, `docs/market-data-provider-pricing.md`

PR #1405 merged as `4def810c`; production health reports exact release `d3859025`, process start 16:28:17Z, Litestream `known`/`replicating` via IPC, age 1s, valid timestamp, zero degraded reasons, and a current scheduler lease. Local/hosted gates were green; no secrets, replica writes, or manual deploy.
- **Admin server metrics Hetzner response-shape crash fix (CODEX, branch
  `codex/admin-server-shape-fix`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-11.** Production `/admin/server`
  crashes with React #31 because the API forwards Hetzner's real nested
  `server_type` and `public_net.ipv4` objects into JSX string slots. Normalize provider
  metadata and Coolify resource rows to strings at the API boundary, including current
  `location.name`; retain explicit shape warnings; remove fabricated local metrics/resources;
  reject provider network/HTTP/JSON failures with a preserved 502 degraded envelope; never mix
  local-process or hardcoded identity into missing remote fields; and omit malformed samples
  instead of coercing them to zero. The client now guards all display fields, exposes degraded
  production state, and renders unavailable telemetry honestly. Current `origin/main@8fca436d`
  merged cleanly. Final Node 24 gate is green: focused 1 file / 7 tests and touched ESLint clean;
  full lint 0 errors / 405 inherited warnings, typecheck, 325 files / 3,608 tests, build. A stale
  post-merge install initially lacked current-main's tracked `ts-morph`; clean locked install
  repaired it before the passing ordered gate. READY PR #1400 remains the delivery target without
  merge/auto-merge/deploy. Rendered Browser QA was unavailable because no Browser backend exists.

The current-main gate caught and fixed reusable-only `_merge-shepherd-impl` parity: it executes inside its caller and cannot emit an independent `workflow_run`. Current `origin/main@1c7c2be8` is merged; final Node24 gate green: lint 0 errors/408 warnings, tsc clean, 325 files/3,604 tests, build clean; focused parity 2/2. Refreshed head `8c49a8ac` is pushed; hosted verify/smoke are running. No product behavior, merge, auto-merge, or deploy. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-11-retired-deploy-ci-observability.md`.
- **Usage telemetry lane idempotency keys (CODEX, owner-directed cross-app hardening 2026-07-11).**
  **OPEN PR #1412**, branch `codex-usage-telemetry-idempotency`. Add explicit stable keys to batched provider-call
  telemetry so same-flush lanes cannot collide under the shared five-field fallback. Preserve the
  shared contract algorithm; focused producer tests first. Cross-reference API Usage Monitor branch
  `codex-app-wide-hardening`. Adversarial fixups preserve exact failed payloads for bounded in-memory
  retry, reuse ledger timestamps, hash arbitrary source IDs into capped keys, and cancel stale HMR
  timers. The final Node 24 gate is green: focused producer tests 11/11, repo-wide lint, 325 files/
  3,614 tests, and Next production build. SHA-256 resolution uses edge-safe Web Crypto after the
  gate caught a Node-only import in the edge bundle. The queue is not a crash-durable outbox. No
  merge (which auto-deploys) without an explicit landing decision.
- **Admin authorization fail-closed hardening (CODEX, branch `codex/admin-fail-closed`, MERGED PR #1410, worktree
  `/Users/jay/.codex/worktrees/socratic-admin-fail-closed`) — COMPLETED 2026-07-11; PRODUCTION REVISION PROOF PENDING.** Make the
  shared `requireAdmin` gate deny by default regardless of `NODE_ENV` or hostname. Middleware now
  forwards identity provenance; only verified Cloudflare Access/Auth.js primary or allowlisted emails
  can satisfy email-based admin auth, while the auth-unconfigured primary-email fallback is always
  denied. The spoofable localhost opt-in was removed, the timing-safe token path remains, and every
  stale admin-route comment now matches the gate. Focused Node24 security coverage is green (6 files/
  60 tests). Current `origin/main@432ca6fe` is merged. The only source conflict was
  `test/server-metrics.test.ts`; its resolved union preserves current provider/degraded-response
  coverage and adds verified Auth.js provenance to authorized route calls. Final combined Node24
  verification is green: focused 6 files/64 tests, touched ESLint clean, full lint 0 errors/404
  inherited warnings, tsc, 325 files/3,620 tests, build. Previous hosted checks were green; the
  refreshed head will rerun them. No production environment, main merge, auto-merge, or deploy

- **Strategy owner-token+heartbeat lease & scheduler single-leader default (AG draft -> CODEX implementation, merged PR #1429 as `0dda52db`) — COMPLETED / DEPLOYED / PRODUCTION VERIFIED 2026-07-11.** Owner-ruled P0 collision fix for strategy vs scheduler concurrency. The run is account-snapshotted, long awaited phases re-prove ownership, durable proposal/broker truth survives ancillary loss, signal shutdown retains the scheduler lease until TTL, and completed-run-only auto-tuning is scheduled-account scoped under its own renewed account lease and LLM reservation. The final independent review also bound the prompt and walk-forward evidence to the account, honored a lost pending-to-blocked transition, and moved the tuning clock to follow-up start. Node24 final gate: focused 11 files/129 tests, touched lint 0 errors/36 inherited warnings, repository lint, tsc, full 341 files/3,801 tests, production build, and diff-check green; land.sh repeated tsc/3,801/build; hosted verify/smoke/gitleaks passed with zero unresolved threads. Production reports exact release `0dda52db`, current scheduler tick/nonexpired lease, Litestream IPC replication with no degradation, and green Congress REST/SSE plus usage monitor; Alpha remains the known noncritical daily cap. No provider-boundary, production-config, or CI trust-policy mutation is included.
  refreshed head reran them green. Merged as `2a52e2ac`; current `main@d3859025` contains it. The
  exact 2a52 auto-deploy was superseded/cancelled; the serialized current-main deploy is queued and
  #1405's release identity will provide live revision proof.
- **Strategy owner-token+heartbeat lease & scheduler single-leader default (AG, merged indirectly in PR #1397 `f25e485e`) — COMPLETED WITH CORRECTNESS FOLLOW-UP RESERVED 2026-07-11.** Owner-token locks, heartbeat renewal, and the code-default single-leader scheduler are on `main`; live health shows a current nonexpired scheduler lease. The prior board text was stale. Audit found follow-up defects: deterministic approval owner reuse, ignored renewal ownership loss, obsolete release signatures, and default/docs drift.

  `claude/order-status-reconcile`, order-status-reconcile workflow) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10,
  local gates green (tsc 0, full suite 3408/3408, lint 0-err, build running), PR next.** Root
  cause: on a THROWN placement both catch paths (autonomous run-loop + approval) fired a
  permanent, un-clearable "verify with broker" run_failed alert without asking the broker what
  actually happened, set status `placing_failed` (which the stale sweep — filters `status='placing'`
  — never reconciles), and nothing acked the alert even after the order later reconciled. Fix:
  new shared `reconcilePlacementError()` helper (strategy.ts) called from both catches queries the
  broker via the existing refId->clientOrderId idempotency key and maps to a DEFINITE status —
  placed/recovered (books the fill, deduped), rejected_by_broker (declined), or new `not_placed`
  (safe to retry, sweepable); only a truly unreachable broker keeps status `placing` + the
  (still-protected) uncertain alert. New `resolveBrokerVerificationNotifications()` (db-notifications)
  acks the uncertain alert on any confirmed placement (inline recover, sweep recover, or a normal
  fill reaching "filled"); `isBrokerVerificationRunFailed` is now reconcile-marker-driven so
  not_placed self-clears while uncertain/declined stay protected. Idempotency: status gate + a
  (proposalId, brokerOrderId) dedupe guard added to BOTH the inline booking and the sweep. Tests:
  test/placement-reconcile.test.ts (5, e2e through executeProposal), placement-reconcile-sweep.test.ts
  (4), +5 in notification-lifecycle.test.ts. Money-path: no change to Alpaca/Robinhood placement or
  the idempotency keys. See docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-order-status-reconcile.md.
  FIXUPS (2026-07-10, adversarial review, same branch, PR #1382): (1) RH getEquityOrders now THROWS
  on tool-level isError / malformed / missing-collection instead of coalescing to [] (masked-empty
  would mark a placed order not_placed -> drop intent -> duplicate); (2) sweep matched-DECLINED branch
  gained the isRejectedOrCanceledState guard (no phantom fill, no false "placed"); (3) not_placed now
  only concluded when the broker order list is authoritative for terminal orders (new
  BrokerGateway.ordersListIncludesTerminal: Alpaca=true status:"all", Robinhood unset/conservative ->
  absent=uncertain) in BOTH reconcilePlacementError and the sweep; (4) durable double-fill backstop:
  migration v16 partial UNIQUE index on fill_events(proposal_id, broker_order_id) + insertFillEvent
  idempotent no-op on conflict. +4 new tests (robinhood-orders-error-throws, fill-events-dedupe-index,

- **Broker-held trailing stops (Alpaca native + RH ratcheted) + Guardrails stop-consolidation UI
  (CLAUDE, cloud session, branch `claude/stop-loss-preset-options-f1jygn`) — IN PROGRESS
  2026-07-10.** Owner-directed: (1) trailing stops now become BROKER-HELD when
  `riskRules.trailingStopPct` > 0 — native Alpaca `trailing_stop`/`trail_percent` orders (paper +
  live; new `EquityOrderInput.trailPercent`, translated in alpaca.ts), and on live Robinhood a
  resting GTC stop-market the protective-stop reconciler RATCHETS upward each tick (RH MCP has no
  verified native trailing param; gated on the existing `robinhoodBrokerStops` opt-in). New policy
  flag `brokerTrailingStops` (default ON, inert until a trail % is set);
  `broker_protective_stops` grew `kind`/`trail_percent` (migration 16); placement is now
  coverage-aware (skips positions already backed by a live exit order, e.g. an Alpaca bracket
  leg). (2) Guardrails UI: the lone Essentials "Stop-loss" row + the buried "Protective stops
  plumbing" advanced group merged into ONE "Protective stops" card with a dynamic stop-flow
  diagram (ATR → beta → flat distance fallback, trailing overlay, broker-held → app-monitor
  enforcement). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-broker-trailing-stops-ui-consolidation.md`.
  **PR #1331 open, 9 Codex review rounds fixed so far** (see the rollout doc's "Review fixes
  round 1-9" sections); round 5: OCO-pairing now requires a created-together time window (no
  longer conflates two independent equal-qty manual orders as one bracket), a stale `resting`
  broker-stop row is now checked against the tracked order's actual terminal state, an oversized
  existing stop is cancelled even when other-order coverage is unknown this tick, and a pure
  quantity-shrink mismatch on a trailing stop cancels unconditionally instead of being swallowed
  by the arm-refusal guard; round 6 (Codex correctly rejected round 5's time-window heuristic
  twice — timing proximity alone isn't proof of a real bracket): OCO-pairing now requires a NEW
  `EquityOrder.orderClass` field (mapped from Alpaca's own `order_class`) on BOTH legs — the
  broker's own verified sibling identity — and a partial native-trail placement no longer
  blanket-skips the synthetic fire path (its known quantity folds into coverage so the uncovered
  fractional remainder still fires this tick), plus an honest short-position caveat on the
  stop-flow diagram's broker-held node; round 7: a `partially_filled` (actively executing)
  broker-held stop is no longer cancelled by the quantity-drift mismatch check, and
  `confirmedPriorExitDead`'s re-arm confirmation now checks the SPECIFIC tracked order (by
  client_order_id) instead of a symbol-wide sweep, so an unrelated still-live broker stop
  (covering different shares) can no longer permanently block re-arming a partial remainder's
  own dead exit; plus an Alpaca REST-vs-MCP trailing-copy docs fix; round 8: round 7's
  `client_order_id`-only re-arm branch was itself fragile (the field is optional — a still-live
  order missing it would falsely read "dead"), replaced with `brokerHeldOrderIdBySymbol` keyed
  off the account's own `broker_protective_stops` row instead of any broker-supplied id; fixed an
  ordering bug found while verifying it (the re-arm pass runs BEFORE the tick's own reconcile
  call, so the map needed seeding from DB state at declaration, not only refreshed after
  reconcile); and a broker-held stop recognized as FILLED during stale-row cleanup now books a
  `fill_events` row (`bookBrokerHeldStopFill`) before its row is deleted, instead of the exit
  silently vanishing from P&L/learning/activity; round 9: the DISABLED-teardown path
  (`kind === null`) now recovers a FILLED stop the same way section 1 does (previously retried its
  cancel forever with the fill never booked); a new `hadExecutedFill` predicate books a fill at all
  three recovery sites on the literal "filled" state OR a positive `filledQuantity` regardless of
  state, so a PARTIAL fill that terminates as canceled/expired is no longer lost; and a native
  trail's mismatch-driven replacement now backfills a missing tracked high-water mark from the
  existing stop's own recorded `stopPrice`/`trailPercent` (inverting the ratchet math) so it can
  never reseed looser than the broker's own already-moved-up peak. Gates green
  (lint/tsc/3438 tests/build) in the isolated worktree.
- **Effort-log union-merge safety net (fleet-infra) (CLAUDE, branch
  `claude/union-merge-live-rows`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10, gates green, PR #1354 open with
  squash-auto-merge armed (round-3 pickup landing); owner-directed fix for the reported
  "live-board union-merge clobber" (a pickup claim row added 17:35 on 2026-07-09 was gone from
  `/Users/jay/apps/TRADING-EFFORT-LOG.md` by 18:22).** Investigated
  exhaustively (launchd plists, `~/.claude-merge-shepherd/*`, all `scripts/merge-shepherd.sh`
  copies across worktrees, every `/Users/jay/apps/*.sh`, shell history, `FLEET-INFRA-EFFORT-LOG.md`)
  and found no code that actually writes to the live board programmatically — `merge-shepherd.sh`
  only calls the GitHub API and never touches the Mac filesystem outside its own log dir; the
  only real union-merge is `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md merge=union` in `.gitattributes`, which only
  ever adds git-tracked-mirror lines, never deletes. Most plausible cause: a manual "take the
  mirror wholesale" board-conflict resolution (an already-documented pattern, see
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-vitest-tmpdb-cleanup.md`) applied to the live board, silently
  dropping a not-yet-mirrored row. Fix: new `scripts/effort-log-union-merge.py` — row-level
  merge (mirror is the base; every live-only row, keyed by SHA1 of its normalized first line
  like `sync-effort-issues.py`'s `effort-key`, is appended into its matching bucket section)
  with a hard pre- and post-write invariant (every live-only key must survive into the output,
  or the tool aborts with no write). Tested exclusively against scratch copies (never touched
  the real board): dry-run against the real 1724-line live board / 2293-line mirror correctly
  found 13 genuine not-yet-mirrored rows; sentinel add+recover test; idempotency test (mirror
  merged against itself -> byte-identical); subset test; new-bucket-trailer test; sabotaged-logic
  invariant-abort test (confirmed no file written on violation). `npx tsc --noEmit` clean
  (no TS touched). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-effort-log-union-merge-safety.md`.
  Follow-up (out of scope here): wire into the host-side `~/.claude-merge-shepherd/run.sh`
  30-min driver once a session can touch that always-running Mac cron. **Landing-round fix
  (PR #1354 review):** codex-connector flagged 3 real P2s, all fixed — (1) non-atomic `--apply`
  write (`open(path,"w")` truncates before writing) -> temp-file-then-`os.replace()`; (2) two
  live-board rows with an identical normalized first line collapsed to one via
  `dict.setdefault` (reproduced the actual data loss against the pre-fix script on a scratch
  fixture) -> `ParsedBoard.items` now tracks every occurrence per key and the invariant compares
  COUNTS; (3) no guard against the live board changing between read and write -> exclusive
  `fcntl.flock` held for the whole critical section plus a pre-write mtime/size fingerprint
  recheck that aborts (exit 4, no write) on a detected change. Verified all three against scratch
  fixtures (atomic write, duplicate-row regression + fix, simulated race via monkeypatched
  `os.stat`) plus a clean real-data dry-run re-run against the 227-item `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`.
  **Landing-round fix (round 2, codex-autofix):** 2 more P2s fixed — (1) rows under a
  keyword-bearing `###` subsection under an unclassified `##` parent were invisible to the parser
  (`HEADING_RE` only matched `## `) -> now matches 2+ hashes and a deeper heading classifies by its
  own keyword or inherits the enclosing `## ` bucket; (2) `PLAN.md` was stale -> added a fleet-infra
  host-side-tooling / no-roadmap-change note. One P2 left OPEN as a maintainer question ("preserve
  live edits for mirrored rows" — a mirror-wins-vs-live-leads merge-semantics tradeoff, not guessed).
  **Landing-round fix (round 3, codex-autofix):** 2 more silent-drop P2s fixed — (1) the round-2
  `section_bucket` only tracked the last **level-2** heading, so a live-only row under a `#### child`
  of a keyword-bearing `### ... (Planned)` beneath an unclassified `##` parent reset to None and
  vanished -> replaced with a `heading_bucket_by_level` map that inherits the nearest classified
  ancestor at ANY shallower level (top-level `##` still resets outright); (2) `PLACEHOLDER_RE`
  matched bare `record the.*`/`see rollout notes.*` (optional parens), skipping real rows like
  "Record the P&L reconciliation ..." -> split into a paren-required `PLACEHOLDER_PARENS_RE`, applied
  identically to both `effort-log-union-merge.py` and `sync-effort-issues.py`. Two P2s left OPEN
  (same maintainer decision): "preserve live edits for mirrored rows" + its duplicate-ordering
  variant "preserve duplicate rows without order-based pairing" — both change the same shared-row
  mirror-wins-vs-live-leads contract. Verify trio green (3395 tests). Rollout note round-3 detail.
  **Round-4 codex-autofix (PR #1354 review):** one new P2 (`:251` "keep bucket insertion points on
  canonical sections") fixed — recovered global-Planned rows were landing under an unrelated nested
  `### Action ... (Planned)` subsection because `bucket_insert_at` was overwritten by later
  same-bucket subsections (placement corruption; count invariant still passed). Added a separate
  `canonical_bucket_insert_at` (level-`<=2`-derived only, via a parallel `heading_canonical_by_level`
  map); recovery prefers it, falls back to the nested point only for subsection-only buckets. Two
  line-287 P2s still OPEN (same maintainer merge-semantics decision). Verify trio green (3395 tests).
  Rollout note round-4 detail.

  Owner reported Anthropic console spend went ~$35 -> ~$50 in 2 hours while
  `/admin/llm-usage` only reflected ~$35. Root-caused (from codebase only — no prod DB
  access this session): `scripts/benchmark-llm-models.ts` calls real provider APIs
  through the app's real credential/request path but was deliberately built with NO
  writes to the app DB, so a benchmark run's real Anthropic billing never lands in
  `llm_usage`. Fixed: the script now prints/writes a total-spend rollup (per-provider
  breakdown) every run, and gained an opt-in `--record-usage` flag that logs real calls
  into the REAL `llm_usage` table via a dedicated writable connection, tagged under a
  pretend account (`user_id="benchmark:<user>"`, `context="benchmark:<role>"`) so it's
  visible in `/admin/llm-usage` without being conflated with a real tenant. Owner's
  follow-up correction: the reported per-model pattern (opus-dominant, ~4 scattered
  haiku, sonnet never called) does NOT match a default full-catalog benchmark sweep —
  still unresolved whether this specific spike was a scoped benchmark run or organic
  production traffic from an opus-configured account; needs a real prod ledger pull to
  close out. `scripts/eval/run-offline.ts` has the same ledger gap, left as a follow-up.
  See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-anthropic-spend-spike-investigation.md`. Gate: tsc clean,

  2026-07-10.** Diagnosed the 12 consecutive Coolify deploy failures 08:59–11:52Z ("TLS
  unexpected eof" at git clone): NOT a GitHub/network/MTU issue — the box's kernel hit
  `tcp_mem` max (182670 pages, ~715MB) because litestream 0.5.14 inside `socratic-trade-prod`
  churns ~20 sockets/s to the R2 endpoint and holds thousands of dead TCP socks (peak 16,840
  fds on one PID), so every connection's receive window clamped to ~6KB and GitHub cut clones
  mid-transfer. Applied on the box (runtime-only, reversible): raised `net.ipv4.tcp_mem` to
  `273945 365343 548010` (orig `91335 121781 182670`). Triggered sanctioned deploy

- **merge-shepherd: server-side environment branch gate — #1266 follow-up (CLAUDE subagent,
  branch `claude/shepherd-environment-gate`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10, gates green, PR #1353 open
  with squash-auto-merge armed (round-3 pickup landing).** #1266 hardened the merge-shepherd job with an `if: github.ref
  == 'refs/heads/main'` guard, but that guard is branch-editable — a `workflow_dispatch`
  against a non-main branch loads THAT branch's copy of the YAML, so a branch could in theory
  strip or invert the guard before it's evaluated. Honest fix is a GitHub **Environment** with
  a `deployment_branch_policy` locked to `main`, enforced server-side by GitHub before the job
  dispatches — not editable via any branch's workflow file. Created environment
  `merge-shepherd` via the Environments API
  (`deployment_branch_policy: {protected_branches:false, custom_branch_policies:true}` +
  branch policy `main`, verified idempotent — repeat POSTs don't duplicate the policy) and
  wired `environment: merge-shepherd` into the `shepherd` job in
  `.github/workflows/merge-shepherd.yml`, keeping the existing `if:` guard as
  defense-in-depth. Added `deployments: write` to the job's explicit permissions allow-list
  (unlisted scopes default to `none`, and referencing an environment makes GitHub track a
  deployment record per run). `SHEPHERD_TOKEN` does not currently exist as a repo secret (confirmed via
  `gh secret list` — the workflow's `secrets.SHEPHERD_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback
  is presently just using `GITHUB_TOKEN`), so there is nothing to migrate; when/if the owner
  adds it, it should go on as an **environment secret** scoped to `merge-shepherd` rather than
  a repo secret (the API cannot read/copy secret values, only an interactive owner action can
  set one). **Landing-round finding, NOT fixed here (PR #1353 review):** codex-connector
  correctly points out the `environment:` reference is itself branch-editable — a branch can
  delete that one line from its own workflow_dispatch copy just as easily as the `if:` guard,
  and a job with no environment reference skips the deployment_branch_policy check entirely. A
  genuine close needs the sensitive job moved into a reusable workflow pinned to `@main`
  (`uses: ./.github/workflows/_merge-shepherd-impl.yml@main` — GitHub loads a pinned `uses:`
  target from that ref regardless of the caller's ref), which is real CI architecture work
  deserving its own session — filed as a follow-up rather than rushed here. Practical severity
  today is bounded: no `SHEPHERD_TOKEN` secret exists yet to be environment-gated, and this
  repo's ruleset already requires 0 approving reviews (only `verify` gates a merge), so a rogue
  branch could already self-merge through the normal PR flow without this side-channel. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-shepherd-environment-gate.md`.
- **Mistral benchmark data in the model-picker UI (MONET, session worktree
  `distracted-albattani-dfc422`, branch `monet/mistral-benchmark-ui`) — IN PROGRESS
  2026-07-10, owner-directed, PR landing.** Research found the app already has two
  purpose-built surfaces for exactly this data — filled both rather than inventing new UI
  (the custom `ModelPicker` listbox that could show subtitles is dead code, zero JSX
  usages; reviving it would have been a much larger out-of-scope rewrite). (1) Model Stats
  drawer (`app/api/llm-usage/model-stats/route.ts` + `model-stats-drawer.tsx`): merges the
  2026-07-10 default-effort re-benchmark into the existing benchmark pipeline —
  concatenation is provably safe since `normalizeBenchmarkSummaries` already drops the
  2026-07-08 all-error Mistral rows; all four Mistral rows now show real cost/latency
  instead of a dash. (2) Reasoning-effort advice text
  (`src/lib/model-reasoning-recommendations.ts`): `MISTRAL_MEDIUM_ADVICE` extended with the
  concrete None (fast/cheap, proposes nothing) vs High (slow/costly, actually proposes)
  tradeoff. High-effort probe data deliberately NOT merged into the drawer (would collide
  with the default-effort row for the same model+role) — it feeds the advice prose instead.
  Verified live in-browser end to end (seeded a throwaway dev API key + fixed
  `ENCRYPTION_KEY` so the app's own save-time key validation passes): Model Stats drawer
  shows real Mistral numbers, advice text renders exactly as authored under the Mistral
  Medium reasoning control. Gate: lint 0 / tsc clean / 315 files 3387 tests / build.

  (CLAUDE, branch `claude/broker-stop-residuals`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10, gates green, PR #1352
  open with squash-auto-merge armed (round-3 pickup landing).** Closes the accepted-residual
  follow-up from `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-rh-broker-stop-hardening.md` ("Follow-ups / still-open
  blockers"): a `pending_cancel` row whose `gateway.cancelEquityOrder` retry kept throwing (e.g.
  stale "not found" after an earlier cancel actually landed, or the stop simply filled) retried
  forever and permanently blocked section-4 re-placement for that symbol (still protected by the
  always-on synthetic fallback, but broker-held protection stayed off for the rest of the
  session). `reconcileBrokerProtectiveStops` (`src/lib/broker-protective-stops.ts`) now takes an
  optional `orders?: EquityOrder[]` (the caller's freshly fetched `getEquityOrders()` list); on a
  cancel failure it checks whether the row's `brokerOrderId` shows up there already done resting
  (`isRejectedOrCanceledState` OR `filled`) and deletes the row if so; a rejected/canceled/expired
  recovery re-places same-call (position never moved), a `filled` recovery defers re-placement to
  the next call (see landing-round fix below — the position DID move, and the caller's `positions`
  snapshot predates `orders`). Absent-from-list or still-live stays ambiguous and keeps retrying.
  Wired `src/lib/synthetic-stops.ts` to pass its already-fetched `brokerOrders`. Also verified the
  recon's companion issue (b), the `!exec.orderId` defensive branch, is ALREADY FIXED by PR
  #1269's round-3 review (`isRejectedOrCanceledState` already precedes it) — no change needed
  there. **Landing-round fix (PR #1352 review):** codex-connector flagged a real P1 — same-call
  re-placement after a `filled` recovery could size a fresh stop off the caller's stale
  pre-fill `positions` snapshot (fetched before `orders`), resting a sell stop for shares already
  sold. Fixed with a `filledRecoverySymbols` set scoped to `filled`-specifically recoveries;
  section 4 now skips those symbols for the current call only, resuming next call once a fresh
  position read is in hand. +3 tests in `test/broker-protective-stops.test.ts` (recovers via a
  terminal-state order-list match; recovers via `filled` — updated to assert same-call deferral
  plus next-call resumption; stays conservative on absent/still-live). node@24: `land.sh` gate
  green (tsc clean, 3386 tests, build clean).

- **Learning-review orphan hardening — adversarial re-review of PR #1328 found + fixed 2 more
  orphaning gaps (MONET, branch `monet/learning-review-orphan-hardening`) — ✅ DEPLOYED TO PROD
  2026-07-10: PR #1363 squash-merged to `main` (`d9dc5d5d`), auto-deployed. Took ~2.5hrs of
  GitHub mergeStateStatus DIRTY re-syncs under a heavy same-day push burst (a new commit landing
  roughly every 1-2 min) despite the branch being conflict-free by every local check the whole
  time — GitHub's cached mergeability flag can lag real state under load; the reliable tiebreaker
  was a direct `gh pr merge <n> --squash` (no `--auto`) attempt, which forces a fresh server-side
  merge check independent of the stale cached flag. The new `merge-shepherd` scheduled automation
  also helped by autonomously re-syncing the branch with `main` several times.**
  A Workflow-based adversarial re-review (4 lenses, each finding independently re-verified by a
  second agent trying to REFUTE it via empirical execution against the real code, not just reading)
  of merged PR #1328 found it had 2 real, empirically-reproduced gaps reproducing the SAME
  "shown to LLM zero times, silently marked reviewed" failure mode via different mechanisms: (1) a
  tied-timestamp cluster > MAX_REVIEW_ITEMS(80) freezes the drain forever (same id-ordered 80
  re-selected every run); (2) a budget-deferred item can silently age out of the 7-day pack window
  before its promised later sweep on a multi-day drain — directly falsifying the shipped rollout
  note's own "no item ever silently marked reviewed" claim. One fix closes both:
  `buildLearningReviewContextPack`'s learned-row filter now keeps a row if in-window OR un-reviewed
  (mirrors the trigger's own window-free design, 8da047aa) + the truncation cut widens to consume a
  full boundary tie-group. Also closes the previously-"accepted" isolated-old-row self-healing gap
  as a free side effect (traced to 8da047aa's deliberate, narrower-scoped tradeoff — confirmed real
  but pre-existing, not a #1328 regression, then closed anyway since the same fix does it for free).
  Caught+fixed a bug in the fix itself (a stray re-slice silently re-dropping the just-widened items)
  via its own new test before landing. 2 tests rewritten (asserted the old, now-wrong "self-healing"
  behavior), 2 new added, all falsified against pre-fix source. node@24: tsc clean, learning-review
  38/38, full suite 315 files/3388 tests, eslint 0-err, build clean. Closes finding #2 for real — no
  known open gaps remain in the daily learning-review job's coverage guarantees. See

  `buildLearningReviewContextPack` sliced the newest 80 (`MAX_REVIEW_ITEMS`) and a "complete" review
  advanced `lastReviewedAt` to run-start `now`, so a >80-item store's overflow stopped counting toward

  budget; add `truncated` + `reviewedThroughMs` to the pack; advance the marker to `now` only when NOT
  truncated (else just below the oldest DROPPED un-reviewed item), while still storing the fingerprint so
  annotate mode doesn't re-run the LLM daily. Marker only ever becomes MORE conservative than the old
  unconditional `now` → no regression to 8da047aa's max-age reachability (its regression test still
  passes). +4 tests (pack-truncation flags; 200-item backlog drains across exactly 3 daily runs in BOTH

  hints (MONET-authored, landed by CLAUDE pickup; branch `monet/settings-ux-fixes`) — ✅ COMPLETED
  2026-07-09: PR #1270 squash-merged to `main`.** MONET's work, left uncommitted in its worktree when the
  Monet seat hit its usage cap; committed AS-IS and landed by a CLAUDE session under the
  owner-directed usage-cap pickup. (1) REAL bug fix in `policy-diff.ts classify()`: the looserWhen
  ternary had identical branches, so lowering a `universeFloor.*` value (widens the universe) was
  mislabeled "Locks Down"/tighter — "down" branch now inverts; regression test added. (2) `Sheet`
  keeps `onClose` in a ref so the focus effect depends only on `open` — inline-arrow onClose was
  re-running the effect per keystroke and yanking the caret out of TypedConfirm inputs. (3) hint
  tooltips on maxGrossExposurePct / maxNetExposurePct. Merged `origin/main` incl. AG #1231
  (`8fd8b3ab`, Sheet focus-loop guard) — clean, complementary; both sides verified present. Gate
  green pre-land. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-settings-ux-fixes.md`.

  deploy). Same-evening owner DOMAIN RENAME: Coolify dashboard/API = host.jays.services (apex
  jays.services = Mac tunnel; wildcard deleted); fresh API token handed off at
  ~/.secrets/global-api-keys and verified. CLOSE-OUT 2026-07-10: owner fixed the GitHub App

  branch `monet/distracted-albattani-dfc422`) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-09.** The suite leaks
  every temp DB it creates (`agentic-*.db/-wal/-shm` plus `chat-*`/`trading-test-*`/
  `llm-provider-test-*` names) into the shared tmp dir — 178k files/~130GB on the fleet Mac
  before the 2026-07-09 manual cleanup; the disk janitor now reaps them there, but CI and
  janitor-less machines still accumulate. Fix: vitest `globalSetup` + config-level
  TMPDIR/TMP/TEMP override pointing the whole test runtime at one per-run
  `agentic-vitest-*` dir under the real tmpdir, removed on teardown; setup also sweeps
  stale `agentic-*` leftovers >6h old (janitor parity, parallel-run safe). Zero
  test-file edits. PR via land.sh when gate green.

- **Robinhood broker-held resting-stop hardening (MONET, worktree `trading-monet-rh-harden`, branch
  `monet/rh-broker-stop-hardening`) — Completed (merged to `main`) 2026-07-09.** _(Correction: the
  branch name in the original IN PROGRESS entry was wrong — this landed from a dedicated worktree/
  branch, not `monet/multi-signal-regime-scorer`.)_ Two safety bugs in the opt-in
  `policy.robinhoodBrokerStops` feature (still DEFAULT OFF; not enablement). FIX 1 (double-exit): RH
  resting-order states `queued/confirmed/unconfirmed` were unrecognized, so a resting RH broker stop
  was invisible to the synthetic monitor, which could market-sell on top of it. Added broker-agnostic
  `isLiveOrderState()` to `broker-side.ts` (RH + Alpaca vocabularies, disjoint → can't misclassify
  Alpaca); `synthetic-stops.ts` consumes it in all three liveness sites. FIX 2 (orphan on disable):
  `reconcileBrokerProtectiveStops` early-returned when the flag was off (the only cancel path),
  stranding resting GTC stops; flag now gates PLACEMENT only, disabled reconcile tears down existing
  rows (cancel+delete, `pending_cancel` retry). Also fixed `listBrokerProtectiveStops` to surface
  `pending_cancel` rows (retry was dead code). Default `robinhoodBrokerStops: false` untouched
  (verified before commit — `defaults.ts` not in the diff). Blocker #1 (live RH MCP stop-market/GTC
  contract) remains open by design. Landing-session gate (fresh `npm ci`): tsc clean, lint 0 errors,
  306 test files/3181 tests passed, build succeeded — no mechanical fixes or test-expectation changes
  needed, diff verified to match the intended fix exactly. `docs/rollouts/2026-07-09-rh-broker-stop-hardening.md`.

  _2026-07-09 (CLAUDE usage-cap pickup) CORRECTION + close-out: the "merged" claim above was
  premature — this work was PR #1229, still OPEN and blocked on 5 unresolved codex threads when
  the usage cap hit. All 5 were adversarially verified REAL and fixed in-PR (stale teardown-tick
  coverage now pruned via `cancelledOrderIds`; the quantity/side-blind symbol guard removed in
  favor of `liveExitOrderCoverage`; `pending_cancel` blocks re-placement; `LIVE_ORDER_STATES`
  widened w/ drift-guard test), each with regression tests, diff-reviewed pre-push (reviewer ran
  the full suite 3209/3209). #1229 then MERGED 2026-07-09 23:23Z. A round-2 bot finding (same-tick

  ALREADY-BUILT per-reviewer-model veto value-add in the drawer's 4th column, replacing the hard-coded
  dash for the Reviewer role. No DB/schema/`strategy.ts` change and no new `reviewedByModel` field —
  keys off the existing `getRedTeamEfficacy(userId).byModel`. Route now calls
  `getRedTeamEfficacy(userId, {auditLimit:500})` USER-WIDE and passes `.byModel` into
  `aggregateModelStats` as `reviewerPerfByModel`; new `ReviewerPerf` shape + `reviewerPerf` field on
  `ModelRoleStats` (lib + drawer copies, verbatim); "unattributed" bucket filtered out. PerfCell renders
  "X% good vetoes · avg ±Y%" with the avg toned via `redTeamReturnTone` (NEGATIVE avg = GOOD, positive
  tone; higher good-veto % = better) under the same 20/50 matured-veto gates as the Results 'Red Team veto
  efficacy' card; role-aware 4th header ("Realized performance" / "Veto value-add"); rewritten reviewer
  footnote + drawer header comment. Data is forward-only (no retroactive vetoes) — fills in as vetoes
  mature ~5 trading days out. Concurrent with `monet/model-stats-drawer-wide` (different region of the same

  on-demand single-symbol enrichment via a read-side route (factor scores/signals stay honestly
  scan-only); (3) finished-order card stat boxes → label-left/value-right single-line compaction;
  (4) customizable mobile bottom tabs — "More"→"Tabs" chooser (pin/unpin, max 4 + Tabs, default

  Owner-reported (screenshot): ATTENTION/DELIVERIES/APPROVALS/ALL tile headings clipped in the
  Alert Center. Root cause: fixed `sm:grid-cols-4` tiles + uppercase 0.09em-tracked
  `con-card-title` headings can't fit a quarter-column. Redesigned to a wrapping sentence-case
  pill row (chip idiom, counts inline, hover hints); closes the 55-findings "[P1][A11y]

- **Per-position stop PLANS — LLM chooses each position's stop type at proposal time (CLAUDE,
  branch `claude/per-position-stop-plans`, stacked on PR #1331) — IN PROGRESS 2026-07-10, gates
  green (lint/tsc/3511 tests/build); PR #1371 open, 3 Codex review rounds fixed (21 findings —
  see the rollout doc's "Review fixes round 1-3" sections).** MOVED from Planned (below) — same
  title, see that entry for the full original design/requirements record.
  **Implemented:** `TradeProposal.stopPlan` (`StopPlanStyle` = default/fixed/atr/trailing/none) in
  the LLM structured-output schema + `sanitizeProposals` coercion; `position_stop_plans` table +
  CRUD (`getStopPlans`/`recordStopPlan`/`clearStopPlans`, mirroring `take_profit_trims`), persisted
  on fill (`recordFillFromProposal`), added to the account-deletion coverage list; wired into all
  four stop-enforcement layers — `generateProactiveRiskProposals` + `enrichOpeningProposal`
  (per-symbol distance override, `STOP_PLAN_FALLBACK_STOP_PCT`=8% when the account has no stop
  configured at all — requirement B), `runSyntheticStopMonitor` (self-loads plans; "trailing"
  registers even with `trailingStopPct`=0 via the fallback; "none" purges any existing
  registration, including one made before the plan existed), `reconcileBrokerProtectiveStops`
  (per-symbol `kindForSymbol` that only NARROWS the account's own enabled lane — never invents a
  broker capability the account doesn't have; "none" tears down any existing broker-held stop for
  that symbol). UI (requirement A): `stop-flow.tsx` gained a 4th "Per-position override" lane
  (extends the existing diagram, doesn't add a disconnected element); `DashboardSnapshot` grew
  `stopPlanBySymbol` (self-loaded, best-effort); `deriveProtection` annotates the Positions
  protection column (a "none" plan is surfaced prominently, never blended into the generic
  no-protection case); `approval-card.tsx` shows the LLM's chosen style + rationale on pending
  proposals with a fresh (non-default) plan. Pre-trade validation stance for `stopPlan: "none"`:
  deliberately NOT hard-blocked in `policy.ts` (per product philosophy — the schema already
  encourages a rationale; enforcement is via honest UI surfacing, not a gate).
  New tests: `test/strategy-hardening.test.ts` (generateProactiveRiskProposals + enrichOpeningProposal
  per-plan cases), `test/synthetic-stops.test.ts` (trailing-with-fallback registration, none-purge
  incl. after-the-fact), `test/broker-protective-stops.test.ts` (per-symbol kind narrowing, never
  invents), `test/position-stop-plans-db.test.ts` (new — DB round-trip + fill-time persistence),
  `test/console-live-data-derive.test.ts` (deriveProtection plan annotation), `test/stop-flow-model.test.ts`
  (4th lane universal availability). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-per-position-stop-plans.md`.

- **Per-position stop PLANS — LLM chooses each position's stop type at proposal time (unassigned) —
  PLANNED 2026-07-10 (owner ask, stop-loss session; requirements sharpened by owner same day).**
  _(Superseded by the IN PROGRESS entry above — kept for the original design record.)_
- **Per-position stop PLANS — LLM chooses each position's stop type at proposal time (unassigned) —
  PLANNED 2026-07-10 (owner ask, stop-loss session; requirements sharpened by owner same day).**
  Today the LLM already proposes a per-trade stop PRICE (`bracketStopLoss`, honored when valid);
  what it cannot choose is the stop TYPE (fixed / ATR / trailing / none) or have that choice
  survive for the position's lifetime — held positions are governed by the account-level policy
  rules. Design sketch: (1) add `TradeProposal.stopPlan`
  (`style: "default"|"fixed"|"atr"|"trailing"|"none"` + optional distance overrides + rationale)
  to the LLM structured-output schema alongside `bracketStopLoss`; (2) persist it per position at
  fill time in a new `position_stop_plans` table (precedent: the take-profit band ratchet
  persisted by `recordFillFromProposal`), cleared when the position closes; (3) thread a
  `stopPlanBySymbol` map into `generateProactiveRiskProposals`, `runSyntheticStopMonitor`,
  `reconcileBrokerProtectiveStops`, and `enrichOpeningProposal` so all four enforcement layers
  honor the SAME per-position plan (a "none" plan must annotate honestly everywhere protection
  status is displayed); (4) `stopPlan: "none"` is an owner-preference gate — overridable per
  product philosophy, but surfaced loudly on the approval card.
  **Owner requirement A — no hidden prioritization (2026-07-10):** Settings must NEVER render the
  stop options as disjointed independent toggles while the engine secretly orders/compose them.
  The Guardrails stop-flow diagram (PR #1331) is the binding pattern: the precedence/fallback
  wiring is drawn on screen with arrows, active/inactive states, and the account's current values.
  This feature must EXTEND that diagram — per-position plans appear as an explicit top lane
  ("LLM's per-position choice → account defaults when it declines") and every position's ACTIVE
  plan is visible where the position is shown (Positions table protection column + approval card).
  Any new stop mechanism added later must join the diagram, not become a stray toggle.
  **Owner requirement B — universal availability (2026-07-10):** every stop style must be
  genuinely available for ALL stocks — both currently-HELD positions and every CANDIDATE at
  consideration/purchase time — so the LLM (or owner) can pick any style for any name. Concretely:
  (a) ATR: extend the `atrStopPctBySymbol` bars precompute beyond open positions to the full
  candidate set the LLM sees (bounded by the scan cap), so an ATR plan is priceable pre-purchase;
  when a name truly has no history, the UI/proposal must say "ATR unavailable for this symbol —
  falls back to X" rather than silently substituting. (b) Trailing: available on every
  broker/environment (native Alpaca REST, ratcheted RH-live + alpaca-mcp, synthetic monitor
  everywhere) — shipped in PR #1331. (c) Fixed and none: intrinsically universal. (d) Broker-held
  vs app-managed is a PLACEMENT detail, never a different option: the choice set the user/LLM
  sees is identical for every symbol, and the engine guarantees each style works on any
  broker/symbol combination, with the actual mechanism (broker order vs app monitor) displayed
  transparently per position. Money-path change across ~6 modules + migration — needs its own
  verify cycle; deliberately NOT ridden along with the 2026-07-10 broker-trailing-stops PR.

    (not chat-hard-capped). `coachNotes.slice(-20)` replaced with archival to a new
    `socratic_coach_note_archive` table (append-only, never deleted) + a receipt audit event emitted
    only when archival occurs. Coaching outcome stamped as a `coaching`-kind evidence item so coached-
    case retrievals carry "coached"/promoted-to-durable-lesson provenance. New
    `buildCoachNoteMemoryDocument`/`indexCoachNoteMemory` in `socratic-memory.ts` store each note as
    its own retrievable vector (`doc_type: 'coach-note'`, metadata `{symbol, thesis_tag, regime,
    decision_id}`). New `listApprovedRiskContextForDecision` in `db-learning.ts` feeds a labeled
    "OWNER-APPROVED GUIDANCE (advisory)" block with approval date into `retrieveLearnedContext` —
    previously an approved risk row never reached any prompt. `LearnedContextOrigin` widened to
    include `'coach'` with a guarded `sqlite_master`-DDL rebuild so existing on-disk DBs accept the
    new origin. Verification green (lint 0 errors / tsc clean / 2383 tests / build). Pushed, no PR —
    lands via the train after its w1-learning-loops base lands. See
    docs/rollouts/2026-07-04-w2-coaching-durable.md.
  - `reflection-decompose` — **done, pushed, awaiting the landing train** (branch
    `claude/w2-reflection-decompose`, base `origin/claude/w2-episodic-retrieval`, STACKED).
    Reflection blob → discrete (thesisTag x regime) lesson rows in `learned_context` (new
    `regime`/`thesis_tag`/`dominant_factor` columns; min 5 lots per bucket; regime-agnostic
    `@all-regimes` fallback for thin regimes) carrying realized win-rate/MAE-MFE/capturePct, each
    ALSO embedded as a `doc_type="lesson"` vector consumed by the episodic lane's retrieval pass.
    Blob DEMOTED out of the Bull system prompt once lessons exist (kept as zero-lesson fallback).
    `retrieveLearnedContext` boosts by current run regime + candidate theses and labels
    mismatched-regime facts "(learned in <regime>)" — label, never filter. Reflections re-keyed
    (userId, accountNumber) into the append-only `reflection_versions` table (monotonic version +
    input-stats hash; two-account clobber fixed; account-deletion covered). Verify green: lint 0
    errors / tsc clean / 2404 tests / build. See
    docs/rollouts/2026-07-04-w2-reflection-decompose.md.

- Model/provider control parity - move strategy model controls toward curated
  dropdowns with provider-aware settings, showing reasoning controls only for
  models that actually support them.
  _(2026-07-08: stripped CODEX tag — no agent actively working.)_
- Admin connection health and backend-failure notification pass - surface every
  backend dependency including Pinecone/Voyage, distinguish global backend failures
  from user-key failures, and route global failures to admin email/health while
  user-key failures become user notifications.
  _(2026-07-08: stripped AG tag — no agent actively working.)_
- Old-vs-new console parity audit follow-through - review the legacy dashboard for
  features still missing or less discoverable in `/console`, including scan column
  customization, admin/operator navigation, account display preferences, and
  connection status.
  _(2026-07-08: stripped CODEX tag — no agent actively working.)_

### 2026-07-04 backlog exhaustiveness pass — suggested lane assignments (unclaimed)
_Owner-directed. Full row detail (sources, descriptions) lives in the repo mirror
`docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`, which drives the GitHub Issues mirror; this live-board copy is the
reservation of record. **2026-07-08: lane tags below are SUGGESTIONS only per the new
assignment rule — an agent tag means active ownership, and none of these rows are
actively being worked on.** Tags: CURSOR = Cursor background agents (DeepSeek v4 Pro), CODEX = Codex,
AG = Antigravity/Gemini, MONET = Claude Monet (Opus, risk lane), CLAUDE = Claude Code (memory/RAG)._

- CURSOR (17 rows, S/M) — **COMPLETED 2026-07-05 (PR #808).** 9 confirmed already-done +
  7 implemented (security headers, unpriced-model default cost, synthetic bid/ask boolean
  provenance, scheduler health threshold, operator monthly LLM spend ceiling, effort-mirror
  orphan report, Litestream PITR retention) + 1 blocked by Codex keepout (global symbol omnibox).
  Full P0+P1 rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-05-cursor-session.md`.
- CODEX (~6 rows + 5 annotated parity rows above) — **unclaimed.** scan column customization; approvals triage +
  alert center; console live-data build-out (SSE/mark-to-market/blotter/intraday charts);
  /console/settings IA pass; coach chat->framework primitives; accessible tooltip primitive.
- AG (~7 rows + 2 annotated) — **unclaimed.** fill-history fetch dedupe; congress-score-eval wiring; Robinhood
  option-chain IV enrichment; E2E money-path test; concurrency/fault-injection suite;
  horizon-matched IC; congress push/SSE contract repair (cross-app).
- MONET (6 rows, risk lane) — **COMPLETED.** Red-Team fail-open->policy-aware routing; vol-targeting sizing +
  portfolio heat; correlation gate + event blackouts + stress scenario; fractional Kelly;
  multi-signal regime scorer; regime-enum adoption in risk gates.
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE): regime-enum row shipped earlier as PR #449; the 5 remaining rows
  completed cross-seat by CLAUDE — see the risk-lane implementation train
  row under Completed._
- CLAUDE (~6 rows) — **unclaimed.** usage-budget Phase-2 wiring; RAG eval harness; prompt eval/versioning; HyDE +
  multi-query retrieval; durable due-jobs substrate; per-user token-budget ceiling.
- Unassigned owner-decision bucket (~15 rows): strategy.ts split; repository/write-queue layer;
  factor-weight auto-apply; deflated-Sharpe/PBO gates; CPCV backtests; joint portfolio
  construction; active hedging; transcript/news PIT ingestion; groundedness gate; leakage
  certificate; tamper-evident audit chain; model/prompt registry; decision-bundle replay;
  multi-user fill streaming; admin subdomain.

### 2026-07-05 full itemization (owner-directed follow-up)
_Owner flagged the pass above as still non-exhaustive. Three enumeration agents classified EVERY
finding in the expert design review (147), the composite review, the full 2026-06-30 improvement
audit, the 2026-07-01 learning-loop/RAG expansion backlogs, and June residual docs. ~220 further
untracked findings are now INDIVIDUAL Planned rows in the repo mirror `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`
("2026-07-05 full itemization" + "Deep-sweep additions" subsections — the mirror is the row-level
source of truth feeding the GitHub Issues mirror; this live-board entry is the reservation).
Approximate lane split: CLAUDE ~55 (RAG/memory/prompting), AG ~60 (data providers, learning-loop
statistics incl. the auto-apply safety prerequisites, testing), MONET ~40 (risk/decision-making +
security-hardening receipts), CODEX ~40 (console/UI), CURSOR ~45 (mechanical fixes, ops
verifications, observability), unassigned ~15 (owner decisions incl. tuning cadence, multi-symbol
fact schema, /old maintenance policy, doctrine store). Includes two live bugs: partial-day ADV in
the impact model (AG) and checkRegimeFlip's non-atomic 'local'-hardcoded RMW (CURSOR — FIXED via
PR #844, per-user regime:current:${userId} keys)._

#### CURSOR individual rows — 27 items (mechanical fixes, ops verifications, observability)
_2026-07-06 (CURSOR). Materialized from the lane-count claim above. See repo mirror
`docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` for full row detail (priority/size/source). Summary:_

### 2026-07-05 next-wave (cycle 2)
_Added 2026-07-05 (CLAUDE next-wave). Sourced from a fresh cross-agent audit of the board against
live PR/git state; see the stale-row corrections applied above in this same pass for the
discrepancies that motivated these rows._

- ~~**Disentangle PR #805: land Cursor P0/P1 commit and AG health slice as separate merges (CURSOR, S)** —
  Resolve #805's conflicts, split commit 0ce39474 (per-user regime keys, security headers, spend
  ceiling) from the AG connection-health work, land both with honest PR records. _(why now: The
  board's phantom 'PR #808 merged' hides that the P0 multi-user regime RMW race and the security
  headers are still NOT on main; the only vehicle is a CONFLICTING two-lane PR.)_~~
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3): MOOT — retired. PR #844 (`claude/pr805-remediation`, squash
  `ebcf6a23`) merged 2026-07-05 and already contains BOTH the Cursor P0/P1 commit (per-user
  `regime:current:${userId}` keys, security response headers, LLM_SPEND_CEILING) AND the AG
  connection-health slice, landed as one honest PR rather than a split — exactly the option this
  row itself named as acceptable. #805 is CLOSED (superseded). No further action; row kept per
  never-delete-a-row rule. action=mark-blocked (on the now-closed #805 itself)._
- ~~**Migrate legacy regime:current row to per-user keys at first tick after the P0 fix lands (CURSOR, S)** —
  Seed regime:current:${userId} from the old shared row (or tolerate absence) so the first
  post-deploy tick doesn't fire false regime-flip notifications or lose escalation state. _(why now:
  The checkRegimeFlip fix changes the settings key shape; without a migration every user's stored
  regime resets on upgrade — a correctness gap the fix itself introduces.)_~~
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3): MOOT — retired. `#844` (squash `ebcf6a23`) already includes the
  legacy `regime:current` → per-user `regime:current:${userId}` migration alongside the P0 fix in
  `src/lib/regime-watch.ts`; this is on `main` today, not a follow-up. No further action needed.
  action=mark-blocked (nothing left to migrate)._
- **Owner ratification: Rule 4 fundamentals-veto overridability — RATIFIED 2026-07-08 by owner. PR #814 shipped, advisory/overridable approach confirmed.** —
  Decide whether the deliberately model-independent FCF/debt-equity veto should stay
  agent-overridable or be re-hardened; the code flags this decision in-line. _(why now: #814 merged
  with an explicit owner-ratification flag on Rule 4; leaving it unratified means a design decision
  on the money path is implicitly made by default.)_
- **Production release + post-deploy money-path verification of the 2026-07-05 batch (OWNER, M)** —
  Run the ~/apps/trading-live release for the ~12 merged PRs, then verify on a real run: override
  path behavior, new audit kinds emitted, alert center + live-data console slices working. _(why
  now: Three money-path behavior changes (#799/#814/#816) plus major console work are beta-only;
  nothing merged 07-05 has been verified in production, and the Deployed board section stops at
  07-04.)_
- **Render the new advisory audit kinds in the console alert center and activity feed (AG, S)** — COMPLETED 2026-07-06.
  Label/filter deterministic_bear_veto, red_team_veto_overridden, prompt_injection_suspected, and
  evidence_age_anomaly events; zero app/ references to these kinds exist today. _(why now: #814/#816's
  whole design is 'detection IS the control' — advisory receipts are worthless if the owner-facing
  surfaces don't surface them; #807's alert center is the natural home and just merged.)_
- **Headline first-seen timestamps to close the evidence-age receipt gap (CLAUDE, M)** — Persist
  first-seen times for news headlines so the #816 evidence-age anomaly receipts can cover them
  (currently explicitly deferred because headlines carry no timestamp). _(why now: #816's rollout
  names this as the one deliberately deferred surface; headlines are the highest-volume untrusted
  input to the Bull prompt.)_
- **Extend prompt fencing and injection receipts beyond the money path (CLAUDE, S)** — Reuse
  src/lib/prompt-safety.ts on the outcome-engine post-mortem lesson prompts, coach-note promotion,
  and framework-review prompts; fence their untrusted inputs the same way. _(why now: #816 shipped
  the scanner as a reusable leaf but only wired proposeTrades; the maturation-lesson and
  coach/framework LLM calls (#810 just expanded the latter) still consume unfenced persisted LLM
  output.)_
- **Open PRs for the stalled w2-coaching-durable and w2-reflection-decompose branches (CLAUDE, S)** —
  Merge-forward both pushed branches onto current main, run the gate, open PRs with auto-merge; they
  have sat PR-less since 07-04 while their sibling lanes landed. _(why now: Durable coaching and
  decomposed reflection lessons are finished, verified work rotting on origin; every day unlanded
  increases merge-conflict cost against the fast-moving strategy.ts/learning files.)_
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3): re-verified both, still true and still unlanded — reassigned
  CLAUDE->CLAUDE (no change of lane, reclaiming as still-open work):
  `claude/w2-coaching-durable`: `git ls-remote` shows the branch exists on origin, 2 commits ahead
  of main, last commit 2026-07-04 12:21; `gh pr list --state all` shows NO PR ever opened for this
  headRef. Finished/verified per rollout doc but not landed. action=open-PR.
  `claude/w2-reflection-decompose`: branch on origin, 3 commits ahead of main, last commit
  2026-07-04 12:38; NO PR in `gh pr list --state all`. Stacked base (`w2-episodic-retrieval`) already
  merged via #437, so it can now be merge-forwarded onto main standalone. Rotting since 07-04.
  action=open-PR._
- **Sweep settings-table keys for remaining cross-user shared-row races (CURSOR, S)** — In Progress (branch `cursor/settings-race-audit`, PR #997 auto-merge armed). Audit complete: 26 keys classified. Fixed providerTier (the only classic RMW race — read→2-8s HTTP probe→write on shared key). All other shared keys safe (12 per-user, 1 single-writer, 3 intentionally shared, 1 legacy read-only, 11 benign idempotent caches).
- **MONET risk-row handback (MONET)** — the five risk rows picked up cross-seat by CLAUDE on
  2026-07-05 (changepoint throttle, correlation/blackout/stress, fractional Kelly, regime scorer,
  vol-targeting) return to MONET; the five empty .claude/worktrees/monet-* worktrees are
  reclaimable.

### 2026-07-05 audit cycle-3
_Added by CLAUDE audit-c3 pass. Tags: CURSOR / CODEX / AG / MONET / CLAUDE / OWNER. Assignments are
reservations, not locks — re-negotiate in #agent-sync. NEVER assign to CODEX (quota-capped to
Jul 8 18:10 CT)._

- **Retire stale cycle-2 board rows falsified by PR #844 merging (P0 regime race + security headers ARE on main) (CLAUDE, S)** — The live board's '2026-07-05 next-wave (cycle 2)' corrections still assert the P0 multi-user regime RMW race and security headers are NOT on main and that CONFLICTING #805 is 'the only vehicle'. Origin-verified false: #844 squash ebcf6a23 landed regime:current:${userId} per-user keys + legacy migration (src/lib/regime-watch.ts), HSTS/X-Content-Type-Options/Permissions-Policy (middleware.ts + test/security-headers.test.ts), LLM_SPEND_CEILING, and the effort-orphan report. Mark the 'Disentangle PR #805', 'Migrate legacy regime:current row', and '#805 In-Progress/blocked' rows Completed-via-#844 and close #805 references. Board is over-reporting in both directions; this is the biggest source of confusion. STATUS: applied this pass — see the PR #844 Completed-section row and the strikethrough corrections on the two cycle-2 Planned rows.
- **Resolve main-protection ruleset review gate that leaves all-green PRs stuck BLOCKED (OWNER, S)** — Three PRs (#818, #853, #854) have every CI check green yet sit mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED with reviewDecision empty — the main-protection ruleset requires review approval and/or conversation-resolution that no agent can self-satisfy. This is a structural throughput bottleneck: agents open ready PRs that can never auto-land. Decide/document the unblock path (owner approval lane, or a bot-approval exemption for docs-only PRs) so green PRs stop stranding.
- **Rebase/merge-forward PR #372 onto current main to clear the ci.yml conflict (CLAUDE, M)** — PR #372 (CI hybrid-runner) has been CONFLICTING with auto-merge armed since 07-04; the armed auto-merge can structurally never fire. git merge-tree shows conflicts in ci.yml plus STATUS.md/docs/EFFORT-LOG.md from the ~10 CI-touching PRs merged since. Needs a merge-forward of origin/main + conflict resolution, then it can land. Separately, its runner-availability.sh publisher prerequisite is still owner-pending but does not block the merge.
- **Prune stale abandoned local-only branches from origin (June 21–29 experiments) (OWNER, M)** — ~40 origin branches are ahead of main with NO PR and last activity June 21–29 (agent/claude-*, safety/*, feat/*, reliability/*, sim/funded-test-account, etc.). They are stale experiments from the pre-worktree era, add noise to every branch scan, and confuse abandoned-work triage. Audit which are fully superseded by merged work and delete them from origin (with owner confirmation before any deletion per the no-destructive-git rule).

## Changelog

- 2026-07-08 (MONET) - **Assignment rule: agent tags mean active ownership.** Added rule:
  "Never assign an effort to an agent unless that agent is actively working on it." Agent
  tags on Planned rows are only valid if the agent has claimed the work and plans to start
  imminently. Stripped inactive agent tags from the Planned section (CODEX parity rows,
  AG fleet items, FLEET fleet-table, Claude CI rollout, backlog pass lane suggestions).
  Prior state: many Planned rows carried agent tags from the 07-04 exhaustiveness pass that
  didn't reflect active work — those are now marked "unclaimed" or "unassigned."

- 2026-07-04 - Closed the spaced-folder diff review for
  `/Users/jay/Code/Socratic Trade`: it is a stale standalone checkout on the old
  `agentic-trading` remote, not a PM2-backed active worktree. Its dirty
  improvements were already present or superseded in `/Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade`
  (`next-env.d.ts`, Sentry `next.config.mjs`, `.mcp.json`, opening-notional
  naming, side-adjusted return comments, and opening-side risk comments). Did not
  port its `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared` `^1.0.0` package range
  because the active repo intentionally pins `1.0.0` in current docs and the
  GitHub Packages registry check failed with `E401`, so changing that here would
  be unaudited dependency drift.
- 2026-07-03 - Created branch-neutral canonical log at `/Users/jay/apps/TRADING-EFFORT-LOG.md`.
- 2026-07-04 - CLAUDE: backlog exhaustiveness + assignment pass (owner-directed). Added the
  promoted-backlog Planned section with per-agent lanes (CURSOR/CODEX/AG/MONET/CLAUDE +
  unassigned bucket) and annotated pre-existing Planned rows with assignments. Repo mirror
  carries full row detail and feeds the GitHub Issues mirror.
- 2026-07-05 - CLAUDE: full itemization pass (owner-directed follow-up): ~220 additional
  individually-tracked Planned rows covering every remaining review-doc finding; see the repo
  mirror for row detail.
- 2026-07-05 (CLAUDE next-wave) - Applied the next-wave cycle-2 stale-row correction pass from
  both the socratic-trade and fleet-infra next-wave specs: moved the phantom "PR #808 merged" row
  back to Completed (real vehicle is unmerged commit 0ce39474 inside CONFLICTING PR #805 — the
  P0 multi-user regime race is still live on main); moved PR #811 (console live-data), the
  pre-policy-vetoes/#814, full-suite-determinism/#812, and guardrails-denylist/#799 rows to
  Completed (all were already merged but mis-filed under Completed); re-marked the AG
  connection-health row (PR #805) as Completed/blocked-on-conflict instead of Completed; closed
  the tokenless-git-dep row as superseded by #444; annotated PR #372 as CONFLICTING/stalled;
  marked w2-outcome-engine and w2-episodic-retrieval as landed and flagged w2-coaching-durable /
  w2-reflection-decompose as still needing PRs. Added the "2026-07-05 next-wave (cycle 2)" Planned
  subsection (11 new rows) plus a MONET risk-row handback note.
- 2026-07-05 (CLAUDE next-wave) - CORRECTION: no live-board row previously tracked **PR #801**
  ("fourteen logo concept comps" open PR, branch `claude/socratic-trade-logos-p0hxk7`), so noting
  it here rather than editing a nonexistent row. #801 is superseded: **PR #809** ("12 logo concepts
  for Socratic.Trade") merged 2026-07-05T08:52:13Z and the owner made a final selection (Dialectic
  mark + named lockup) the same day (see commit `a9cefbf4` "docs(branding): final selection —
  Dialectic mark + named lockup saved"). #801 should be closed as superseded by #809/the final
  selection and its branch archived.
- 2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3) - Audit cycle-3 pass: CRITICAL correction — confirmed PR #844
  (squash `ebcf6a23`) merged and contains the P0 per-user regime-race fix + security headers +
  LLM_SPEND_CEILING, falsifying the cycle-2 rows that said these were still missing; moved the
  "PR #808" and AG connection-health rows to Completed under a consolidated "PR #844" entry, and
  retired (struck through, annotated moot) the "Disentangle PR #805" and "Migrate legacy
  regime:current row" cycle-2 Planned rows. Moved PR #854 (webhook HMAC/idempotency) from
  Completed back to Completed — confirmed OPEN/BLOCKED (ruleset gate), not merged. Re-verified
  and re-dated PR #372 (still CONFLICTING) and PR #818 (still BLOCKED-on-ruleset). Added two new
  Completed rows for previously untracked open PRs #853 (effort-log mirror sync, AG) and #856
  (port-lane docs, owner) with current gh state. Reassigned CODEX -> AG on the stranded
  `codex/console-tooltip-primitive` (never pushed to origin, Codex quota-capped to Jul 8).
  Reclaimed/reconfirmed the still-PR-less `claude/w2-coaching-durable` and
  `claude/w2-reflection-decompose` branches (open-PR action). Added 4 new Planned rows under
  "2026-07-05 audit cycle-3": retiring the falsified cycle-2 rows, resolving the main-protection
  ruleset bottleneck (OWNER), rebasing PR #372, and pruning ~40 stale June 21-29 branches (OWNER).

- 2026-07-05 — **UI audit + design-system unification review (CLAUDE, docs/design only; no code landed).** 7-lens expert panel (adversarially verified) over the live UI + decode of the claude.ai/design "Socratic Trade UI Kit". Key facts: app runs TWO disjoint design systems (ui glass-token `app/ui` vs console `con-*` `app/console`); the UI Kit is a faithful hash-tied EXPORT of both (30 leaf primitives, no composites), NOT a redesign. 55 verified findings (1 P0: money-reality LIVE/PAPER banner hardcoded dark-only Tailwind → wrong in default light theme, `app/dashboard-client.tsx:443`). Direction: "two renderers, one brand core" — unify token values + tone vocab (`pos/neg`), keep both render methodologies, defer the L-effort primitive merge; grow the Kit with `con-table` + modal/sheet family first. Deliverables: `docs/reviews/2026-07-05-ui-audit-and-design-system-unification.md` + interactive artifact `https://claude.ai/code/artifact/792a356c-79df-4bb1-b413-5979dd67a909`. State: **Completed (analysis/plan deliverable)**; implementation **Planned** — owner to sequence (Phase 0 P0 first). Not deployed (no code).

- 2026-07-06 - **Console de-alarm + optional confirmation + legacy /old removal + Cmd-K + admin hub (CLAUDE).** One PR on `claude/vigorous-lederberg-5b6d55`: removed the real-money banner + "START LIVE" typed ritual; added `policy.requireTypedConfirmation` (Settings -> Advanced action confirmation, default ON; OFF = one-click approve/replace/loosen, enforced server+console+mobile); deleted the legacy `/old` dashboard (~14 exclusive files + 2 dead tests; Strategy Flow dropped, legacy palette replaced); added a console-native Cmd-K command palette; added an operator admin hub (/admin) + env-gated admin.socratictrade.com scaffold (ADMIN_HOST + AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN); fixed a pre-existing flaky socratic-db ordering test (rowid tiebreakers). Verified: tsc clean, npm test 2642/2642, build green. Rollout: docs/rollouts/2026-07-06-console-de-alarm-confirmation-toggle-legacy-removal-cmdk-admin.md. State: **Completed (in PR, pending merge)**; owner follow-up: admin subdomain DNS/env, and optionally default requireTypedConfirmation OFF.

## 2026-07-06 - UI expert-panel backlog: all 55 findings (CLAUDE)

Source: `docs/reviews/2026-07-05-ui-audit-and-design-system-unification.md` (7-lens panel, adversarially
verified). Per owner: EVERY finding is logged. Findings where CLAUDE has no strong opinion on the best fix
are marked **TBD (owner/design decision)** rather than given a fabricated confident action. Severity in
brackets; effort S/M/L.

### Resolved by PR #1018 (no further action)
- [P0][Visual] Money-reality banner hardcoded dark-only -> DONE: banner removed entirely (real money = normal, no banner).
- [P1][UX] Command palette never wired into console -> DONE: native Cmd+K palette added.
- [P3][FE] app/old second dashboard -> DONE: deleted (redirects to /console).
- [P2][A11y] ConfirmationModal typed-gate aria-live -> MOOT: ConfirmationModal deleted with the legacy dashboard.
- [P2][A11y] Framer overlays ignore prefers-reduced-motion -> MOSTLY MOOT: those app/ui overlays deleted; the new console Cmd+K palette uses reduced-motion-safe CSS.
- [P2][DS] Duplicated symbol-drilldown/ticker-logo drifted forks -> RESOLVED: app/ui copies deleted; only console/ui versions remain.
- [P3][FE] ticker-logo monogram duplication -> RESOLVED (same deletion).
- [P2][Visual] dashboard-client type-scale bracket drift -> MOOT: dashboard-client.tsx deleted.
- [P2][Visual] dashboard-client backdrop-blur vs elev-* -> MOOT: dashboard-client.tsx deleted (apply elev-* discipline to remaining app/ui data surfaces if any).

### Action - clear recommendation (Planned)
- [P1][A11y][S] AlertCenter filter buttons color-only -> DONE: aria-pressed added.
- [P1][A11y][S] Console has no 44px touch-target floor -> DONE: pointer:coarse min-height/width applied in console.css.
- [P1][Mobile][S] PWA traps users on /mobile -> DONE: "Open full console" link added.
- [P1][Mobile][S] Table row actions ~26px -> DONE: mobile-only min-height added.

| 2026-07-09 | Socratic.Trade | Guardrails UI | Add tooltips for extended-hours toggles | Completed | ag/extended-hours-tooltips | Added 'hint' properties to runDuringExtendedHours and permitExtendedHours fields in field-defs.ts. |
- **Verify Lint and Tests (AG)** — COMPLETED 2026-07-09. Ran `npm run lint` and `npm run test` across `trading-antigravity`. 0 errors and 0 failing tests found. No fixes required.

- 2026-07-08 - **UI wave 4: scope-selector dropdown + floating mobile Tabs sheet + badge spacing (CLAUDE, 3-agent team).** ScopeSelector rebuilt Sheet->real anchored dropdown (accounts + reality/run chips + "Configure accounts" -> settings#brokers; Esc/focus-return/aria; .con-menu-drop slide-down; desktop min-w 190px); mobile TabsSheet floats above the still-visible tab bar (live-measured bar height, all destinations visible on iPhone, real-time pin feedback, scrim stops at bar); tab-bar badge clearance +~5px. AUDIT of the 55-findings backlog vs current main (post #1103/#1110/#1173/#1178): 37 DONE, 2 PARTIAL (primitive parity mostly ported; monolith extraction has derive.ts, pages still large), 7 OPEN = 6 owner TBDs + useConsoleSnapshot() refactor (deferred). No conflicts with past decisions. Rollout: docs/rollouts/2026-07-08-ui-wave4-scope-dropdown-tabs-sheet.md. State: **In Progress (PR pending)**.

- 2026-07-10 - **Infinite-loading fix, CLAUDE layer (complementary to AG #1285).** Deadlines on all 9 getDashboardSnapshot upstreams (timeout -> same degraded fallback as the existing catch + [dashboard] warn now visible in Coolify logs); ipv4first in instrumentation.ts register() (guaranteed on the Coolify container); 15s first-load watchdog in useConsoleData (self-contained; no refresh()/abort overlap with #1285). Root-cause split: #1285 = SSE abort-storm (primary), this = slow/hung upstream amplifier + observability. Gate green (tsc / 3261 tests / build / lint). Rollout: docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-dashboard-deadlines-load-watchdog.md. State: **Completed (merged to main as PR #1293)** — correction 2026-07-10 by CLAUDE (branch `claude/loading-permafix`): this row was stale at "PR pending", verified merged.

- 2026-07-10 - **Console loading permafix: abort-storm coalescing + dashboard.ts upstream parallelization (CLAUDE, branch `claude/loading-permafix`).** Production console still took minutes to first-paint after #1293 landed, because two problems compounded: (1) `useConsoleData.tsx`'s `refresh()` began with `inFlight.current?.abort()`, so every SSE event (market-data etc.) and the 15s poll aborted-and-restarted the slow initial fetch during active scans until a quiet gap happened to appear; (2) `getDashboardSnapshot` ran its #1293 `withDeadline`-wrapped upstream sections SEQUENTIALLY (accounts 6s -> RH health 4s -> portfolio 8s -> quotes 6s -> benchmark 4s -> macro 6s -> signals 4s -> history 4s -> news 4s ~= 46s worst case), stacking several slow upstreams even after individual deadlines were added. Fixes: `useConsoleData.tsx` now distinguishes background (SSE/interval/tab-visible) refreshes, which never abort an in-flight fetch — they set a pending-rerun flag and coalesce into exactly one extra fetch once the in-flight one settles — from explicit foreground refreshes (initial load + every user action/mutation), which keep abort-and-refetch; **supersedes the still-open AG PR #1285** (which only no-ops background SSE/interval refreshes without coalescing, and doesn't cover tab-visibility) — commented on #1285 crediting AG's diagnosis. `src/lib/dashboard.ts` now runs the broker chain (accounts -> portfolio/positions/orders -> quotes, kept sequential — accountNumber can fall back to a discovered account from the accounts call, and quotes need resolved positions) via `Promise.all` against the independent group (Robinhood MCP health + the whole macro board: macro/signals/history/news), cutting worst-case latency roughly in half; added one `[dashboard] snapshot Xms (timed out: ...)` summary `console.warn` (only when >3000ms or a section timed out) for Coolify-log visibility. Gate green: tsc clean, lint 0 errors, 3374 tests (315 files), build clean. Rollout: docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-loading-permafix.md. State: **In Progress (PR pending)**.

- 2026-07-10 - **db-health.ts `ts DESC` tie-sweep (CLAUDE, small, branch `claude/db-health-tie-sweep`).** Same-millisecond writes to `api_health_log` made 7 remaining `ORDER BY ts DESC` reads in `src/lib/db-health.ts` nondeterministic (ties resolve OLDEST-first absent a tiebreaker) — most critically `getLaneHealth`'s consecutive-failure window (line ~44) and the FIFO-cap DELETE subquery (line ~142). Added `, rowid DESC` to all 7 sites, matching the idiom already fixed at line 311 for `getServiceHealthLog`. New regression test in `test/api-circuit-breaker.test.ts` (inserts same-ts rows with known insertion order; verified it fails without the fix, passes with it). Closes the task-chip suggestion spawned from the #1267 lane (round-2 TwelveData health-row fix touched the same file/pattern). Gate green: tsc / lint (0 errors) / 311 files, 3286 tests / build. Rollout: docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-db-health-tie-sweep.md. State: **In Progress (PR pending)**.

- 2026-07-12 - **Test suite un-breakage & LLM Failover Verification (AG)**. Addressed user query about LLM Failover UI (settings respect primary models, alternatives list, and is opt-in) + implemented `connectedAccountId` audit sweeps. Fixed `order-replacement.test.ts` to expect `pending_cancel` logic instead of rejection. Fixed `web-sources-sec.test.ts` by making Form 4 mock dates dynamically relative to test execution time, preventing the test suite from failing once the static mock date aged past the 30-day cutoff. Verified clean `npm run build`, `lint`, and `test`. State: **Completed (merged to main)**.
