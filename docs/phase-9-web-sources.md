# Phase 9 - Backend Web Sources (scraped / no-free-API signals)

Status: implemented 2026-06-16 (branch `web-sources`). These are read-only data ingests; broker
paper/live execution remains intrinsic to the connected account.

## 2026-07-13 consumption update

Web-source presence is no longer treated as proof of decision value. The enrichment/strategy path
now retains per-field provenance and availability, provider failures, upstream-family deduplication,
per-run source coverage, and decision-time leave-one-winning-provider-out score receipts. Those
receipts join to matured realized/skipped outcomes as observational source-value telemetry. A failed
source remains distinguishable from a neutral or no-match result.

The same run timestamp is passed into filing retrieval, retrieved text is treated as untrusted data,
and Green/Red receive the same evidence manifest. This does not make source-value estimates causal
or complete the separate SEC corpus backfill; limitations are cataloged in
`docs/reviews/2026-07-13-decision-evidence-architecture.md`.

## Goal

Connect high-value signals that have **no reliable free key-based API** by reading
them server-side from public sources, on a low frequency, and feeding them to the
scoring engine, the agent prompt, and the dashboard — **without ever fabricating a
value**. If a source is down, the signal is simply absent (cells show `—`).

The headline source is **congressional trading**: politicians disclose stock trades
on a delay, and copycat retail flow tends to follow a disclosure. Surfacing fresh
disclosures lets the agent act on the same names *before* the copycats pile in.

## Architecture (`src/lib/web-sources/`)

- **`types.ts`** — `CongressTrade`, `CongressSignal`, `SymbolWebSignal`,
  `WebSourceRefreshResult`, `WebSourceConnector`.
- **`http.ts`** — polite fetch helpers: descriptive User-Agent (browser UA for
  scrape targets; SEC fair-access UA via `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT`), per-request
  `AbortController` timeouts, light retry on 429/5xx, a **sequential rate limiter**
  (`runRateLimited`) so a refresh can't burst a .gov host, and cookie-jar helpers.
- **`congress.ts`** — congressional-trade ingestion. Adapters tried in order:
  1. **Senate eFD** (`efdsearch.senate.gov`) — authoritative, free, no key.
     Validated live: GET `/search/` (CSRF + cookies) → POST `/search/home/`
     (accept terms; the Django CSRF token **rotates** here) → POST
     `/search/report/data/` (PTR filings list) → GET each e-filed PTR view page →
     parse the transactions table. Parsing classifies each cell by *content*
     (ticker / date / amount / Purchase|Sale) rather than fixed column index, so
     it survives column reordering. Paper (PDF) filings are skipped.
  2. **Apify `johnvc` actor** (`us-congress-financial-disclosures-and-stock-trading-data`)
     — **HOUSE coverage** (the eFD gap). Keyed (`APIFY_API_TOKEN`), pay-per-result
     (~$0.00001/row ≈ $0.09/mo daily). Runs the actor synchronously
     (`run-sync-get-dataset-items`) with `Start_Date`=window + `Max_Results`, parses
     normalized House Clerk disclosures (`parseApifyCongress`), and is **House-only by
     default** so it complements eFD's Senate (`WEB_SOURCE_APIFY_CONGRESS_CHAMBERS=all`
     to include Senate). Date sanity-guards drop garbage future dates. Returns `[]` when
     no token. Live-verified: a forced refresh returned 125 House + 61 Senate trades.
  3. **Capitol Trades** (`bff.capitoltrades.com`) — public JSON back-end (House +
     Senate). Best-effort + configurable (`WEB_SOURCE_CAPITOLTRADES_URL`, or set
     it to `off` to disable); their CDN/security layer has returned 503/429 from
     server-side fetches, so it's a tertiary fallback now that Apify covers the House.
- **`sec.ts`** — SEC EDGAR insider (Form 4) ingestion. Reads the market-wide
  "current Form 4" atom feed, resolves each filing's `index.json` → ownership XML,
  and counts **only open-market discretionary** transactions: `P` (purchase) and
  `S` (sale). Codes `M`/`A`/`F`/`G` (option exercise, grant, tax, gift) are NOT
  trading signals and are ignored. Filings accumulate into a rolling window.
- **`index.ts`** — registry + the three entry points the app uses:
  `refreshDueWebSources()` (scheduler), `getSymbolWebSignals()` (scan overlay,
  cache-only / no network), `collectEvidenceBulletins()`, `getWebSourcesStatus()`.

## Persistence + cadence

Datasets persist in the SQLite `settings` KV via `setInternalSetting` (survives
restart), each carrying its own `fetchedAt`. The scheduler tick calls
`refreshDueWebSources()` every 60s, but each connector **no-ops until its cadence
elapses** (default daily; congressional disclosures trickle in daily and getting
ahead of copycats rewards promptness). A refresh **never overwrites a good cached
dataset with nothing** on a transient outage.

Cost per refresh is small and bounded: Senate eFD ≈ 1 search + ≤80 PTR pages
(capped, rate-limited 350ms); SEC ≈ 1 feed + ≤30 filings × 2 reqs (rate-limited
250ms). Both run in the background, independent of whether autonomous trading is on.

### Cross-entry single-flight

Manual admin requests and scheduler/background calls converge at durable operation boundaries,
not only at the route layer. `src/lib/operation-lease.ts` stores owner-token leases in the existing
SQLite `settings` KV and uses an immediate transaction for atomic acquisition, a TTL heartbeat for
long work, and owner-checked release. Congress and SEC 8-K refreshes have separate dataset groups;
Congress daily sharing has its own group; 8-K reindex and 10-K/10-Q filing ingest deliberately share
the `rag-reindex` group because both spend the same embedding/corpus-write capacity.

Contention in a background caller is a typed benign skip: it performs no provider request and does
not advance the connector attempt/daily marker. Admin admission acquires the durable lease before
debiting its per-admin rate budget, passes an opaque claim into the matching core function, and maps
busy outcomes to the shared operation-guard HTTP 409 contract. The detached best-effort embedding
started by `refreshEightK` remains detached; its summary/full-body work can continue after the
primary dataset-refresh lease is released, preserving the established non-blocking refresh contract.
That detached tail does not currently acquire `rag-reindex`; making it fully exclusive requires a
durable pending/retry job or awaiting it, and remains an explicit follow-up rather than a silent claim.

## Wiring into the app

- **Scoring/UI/prompt** — `scanMarket` overlays `getSymbolWebSignals` onto the top
  candidates: it fills `senateTrades` (net distinct buy members − sell members)
  when a keyed provider didn't, fills `insiderSentiment` from SEC Form 4, and
  attaches `evidenceBulletins`. The Market Scan table gained a **Congress** column
  (bulletin as tooltip). The agent prompt now emits `smartMoneyEvidence` per
  candidate with guidance to treat a cluster of recent congressional/insider BUYS
  as a positioning tailwind worth front-running (and SELLS as a caution), as one
  input among many — not a standalone trigger.
- **Dashboard** — `getWebSourcesStatus()` (freshness, record counts, sources, due)
  is on the snapshot for a health indicator.

| `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT` | generic | SEC fair-access UA (set your contact) |

## Adding another source

1. Add a connector module exposing `refresh*`, `is*RefreshDue`, `get*Signals`,
   `get*Dataset`, plus pure parsers (unit-tested with captured real-shape fixtures).
2. Register it in `index.ts`: refresh in `refreshDueWebSources`, merge its
   per-symbol contribution into `getSymbolWebSignals`, add to `getWebSourcesStatus`.
3. If it produces a new numeric field, follow the enrichment add-a-field checklist
   in `docs/phase-4-market-data-scoring.md` / `AGENTS.md` (`CLAUDE.md` symlinks
   there) (interface → union →
   EMPTY_SOURCED → cascade → MarketQuote → market.ts `applyEnrichment` → summary
   projection → prompt → UI).

## Follow-ups

- SEC **8-K** material-event bulletins are now implemented as coarse per-symbol
  "filed an 8-K" catalysts; richer per-item 8-K document summaries remain open.
- Sector is now threaded onto fills and has a scorecard; the composite thesis ×
  regime × **sector** × factor view remains open.
- Substantially-identical / House coverage for congress once a stable free House
  feed is available (the eFD scrape is Senate-only; Capitol Trades adds House when
  its back-end is up).
- Optional providers behind paid keys (Quiver, FMP paid senate/insider) as extra
  adapters in the same connectors.
