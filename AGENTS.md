# Agent Instructions

Read this before making changes. It exists to save you (and whichever other AI
tool touches this repo next — Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity/Gemini, Cursor,
etc.) the time/tokens of re-deriving things a previous session already learned
the hard way.

## Before you start

- `git status` and `git log -3` first. Another tool may have left uncommitted
  work in the tree — read it before editing on top of it, don't assume a clean
  base.
- Check `docs/*.md` for an existing design doc on the area you're touching
  before writing a new one. If you're replacing one, say so explicitly in the
  commit message — don't silently delete+replace without a paper trail (this
  has happened: `docs/phase-7-strategy-learning-loop.md` was fully replaced by
  `docs/phase-7-strategy.md` with a different design, no commit explained it).
- Read `STATUS.md` for the current repo snapshot, then skim the most relevant
  `docs/*.md` and the latest matching note under `docs/rollouts/` before making
  a non-trivial change.

## Pre-Commit / Handoff Protocol (Claude, Codex, Antigravity, Cursor, etc.)

Before every commit/push to the GitHub repo, you MUST update the following:
1. **`STATUS.md`** — current state, blockers, next action.
2. **`docs/rollouts/YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug.md`** — create or update a chronological rollout note detailing what was done, decisions made, what's next, exact touched files, and verification commands run. Do NOT use a single `HANDOFF.md` file, use the rollouts directory.
3. **`PLAN.md`** — reflect any scope, timeline, or approach changes.
4. **Phase docs (`docs/*.md`)** — update the relevant phase doc to match actual implementation state.
5. **Other touched docs** — README, architecture docs, API specs, etc.
6. **Commit Messages** — every commit message should reference which docs were updated.

`AGENTS.md` is for durable repo rules and cross-file traps only. Do not put turn-specific status or a running changelog here.

## Rollout note minimums

- Summary: what changed.
- Why: why it changed or what decision was made.
- Files: exact touched paths.
- Verification: exact commands actually run, plus notable failures if any.
- Follow-ups: remaining work, risks, or deferred items.
- If no code changed but an important decision or blocker was discovered, write
  the note anyway and say that explicitly.

## Verify before claiming done

Run all three, in this order, before saying a change is complete:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit   # type errors — fast, do this first
npm test           # vitest, ~195 tests across 27 files as of 2026-06-18
npm run build      # full Next.js build; also re-checks types
```

`npm run build` deletes and regenerates `.next/`. If a dev server is running
(via Claude Code's preview tool or otherwise), it will start erroring with
`ENOENT .next/server/...` afterward — restart it.

Because `tsconfig.json` includes `.next/types/**/*.ts`, `npx tsc --noEmit` can
also fail when those generated files are missing or stale. If that happens,
capture the exact missing-path error in your rollout note and treat a fresh
`npm run build` as the authoritative regeneration step before re-checking.

If `npx tsc --noEmit` reports errors in `test/alternative-data.test.ts` around
a `mockFetcher`/`URL | RequestInfo` type mismatch — that's pre-existing and
unrelated to most changes; don't spend time chasing it unless you're touching
that file directly.

## Local dev ports (multi-agent coordination)

Several AI tools work this repo and their dev servers otherwise collide on one
port. To keep them from stomping each other, each agent owns its own port (and
ideally its own git worktree so `.next`/file edits don't conflict):

- **Claude Code → port 3000.** Its preview tool defaults here and reclaims 3000,
  so leave 3000 to it.
- **Codex → port 3001.** Start with `npm run dev:codex`; it frees only port
  3001, restarts if Next initially falls off that port, and must not take 3000.
- **Antigravity/Gemini → port 3002.** Start with `next dev -p 3002` or
  `PORT=3002 npm run dev`; do not take 3000.
- Don't kill another agent's dev-server port. Keep the shared `npm run dev`
  script **unpinned** (it defaults to 3000) so each agent overrides the port via
  flag/env — never hardcode a port into the `dev` script.

Production is independent of all of this: the public site (`trading.jays.services`)
runs the *built* app via pm2 on **port 4000** behind a Cloudflare tunnel, so a
coding tool's dev server never affects it. Host-local deployment details live in
`~/apps/README.md` on the deployment machine.

## Cross-file consistency traps (cheap to check, expensive to miss)

- **`TradeProposal`** (`src/lib/types.ts`) requires `tradeThesisTag` and
  `entryMarketRegime` as non-optional strings. Every place that *constructs* a
  `TradeProposal` literal must set them — this includes test fixtures, not just
  production code. Grep `side: "buy"` or `side: "sell"` in `test/*.ts` to find
  construction sites if you change this type again.
- **`OrderSide`** (`src/lib/types.ts`) is `"buy" | "sell" | "short" | "cover"`.
  `src/lib/policy.ts` and `src/lib/performance.ts` now include short/cover
  branches, but this is still high-risk code. If you touch risk, P&L, order
  accounting, or persistence, verify all four sides explicitly. In particular,
  check `src/lib/db.ts` daily-notional tracking before assuming short/cover are
  fully production-ready.
- **Per-field enrichment sourcing** (`src/lib/data-providers.ts`): when adding
  a new enriched field (e.g. another fundamentals metric), wire it through all
  of: the `SymbolEnrichment` interface, `EnrichmentSourcedField` union, the
  `takeScalar(...)` calls in `CascadingEnrichmentProvider.enrich`, the
  `EMPTY_SOURCED` marker map, and the corresponding field on `MarketQuote` /
  `MarketQuoteSummary` in `types.ts` + the merge in `src/lib/market.ts`. Missing
  any one of these means the value silently never reaches the dashboard.
- **Never label real data "mock" or "fallback" in anything user-facing.** The
  enrichment cascade used to end in a synthetic mock tier; it was deliberately
  removed because showing fabricated numbers next to real ones is misleading.
  Yahoo Finance (no API key required) is the floor now — every symbol gets real
  data or the cell shows `-`/`n/a`, never a fake number.

## Conventions

- Source attribution: `MarketScan.source` is a `+`-joined list of every
  provider that actually contributed data this run (e.g.
  `"nasdaq-delayed-screener+finnhub+yahoo-finance+robinhood-quotes"`). Don't
  hardcode a provider name into this string — derive it from what ran.
- P/E ratio display: `"n/a"` means negative/zero earnings (a real, computed
  "no ratio" state); `"-"` means the data simply wasn't available. These are
  not interchangeable — check `eps` to decide which one applies.
- Tests use a temp SQLite file per run via `DATABASE_URL=file:<tmpdir>/...`
  (see `beforeAll` in test files) — don't point tests at the dev `data/app.db`.

## Don't

- Don't run destructive git operations (`reset --hard`, force-push, branch
  deletion) without explicit user confirmation in the current conversation,
  even if a previous session was authorized to push.
- Don't place real trades or toggle `paperMode: false` while testing — Paper
  mode is the default for a reason.
