# isolate-shared-box-batch.sh - soft-cap Congress.Trade OCR/scan batch load.
#
# 2026-08-06: Coolify's multiplexed SSH exec stream died mid-build (exit 255)
# under shared-box contention. Congress.Trade scan-cpu-worker OCR batches ran
# on the same host all day. A retry on a quiet box survived every earlier
# failure point. ST, CT, and UM still share the Hetzner cx43
# (docs/rollouts/2026-08-07-hetzner-fleet-cutover.md).
#
# Shared-box OCR CPU budget (Hetzner cx43 = 8 vCPU):
#   5.0  default -- as high as is reasonably advisable.  Leaves 3 cores for
#        Coolify SSH + ST (including next build) + UM + CT web.  Unconstrained
#        OCR was measured at 2.83 cores (283%) on 2026-08-12; 5.0 sits above
#        that peak so normal OCR is not throttled, but cannot take the box.
#   6.0+ too high -- a concurrent ST deploy + Coolify exec stream died
#        (2026-08-06 exit 255) when batch load left too little headroom.
#   2.0  CT compose runaway floor today; throttles OCR below the 2.83 peak.
# Durable CT compose should use the same 5.0 on scan-cpu-worker (congress-app
# stays at 2.0; combined CT ceiling 7.5 still leaves a core).
#
# This script NEVER restarts a container and NEVER touches Socratic.Trade,
# Coolify, or Usage Monitor. Default is dry-run. --apply requires
# ISOLATE_SHARED_BOX_APPLY=1 so a stray invocation cannot mutate production.
#
# Remaining host constraint (this repo cannot lift it):
#   - docker update limits are ephemeral; the next CT Coolify deploy overwrites
#     them unless the owner sets Coolify CPU limits on congress-app.
#   - If OCR runs in-process inside congress-app-live (no dedicated worker
#     container), capping workers finds nothing. --include-app caps the whole
#     CT app (also caps CT web). The durable fix is a CT-repo scan worker
#     with nice/cpuset, or moving OCR off-box.
#   - Coolify has no job-level retry-on-exit-255 that this repo can set.
#
# Usage:
