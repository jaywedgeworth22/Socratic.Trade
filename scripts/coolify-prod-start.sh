# Boot script for the PRODUCTION app on the Coolify box (socratictrade.com).
# Coolify start_command runs this script directly; it self-wraps in
# scripts/infisical-run.mjs, so by phase 2 the full Infisical `prod` env
# (app secrets + AWS_*) is present.
#
# Phase 1 (no secrets yet): download pinned litestream + infisical CLI binaries
#   onto the persistent volume (cached across restarts), put them on PATH, then
#   re-exec this script under infisical-run.
# Phase 2 (secrets injected), gated by the DB_BOOTSTRAP runtime env var:
#   fresh (default) - start the app with whatever is in /app/data (empty on the
#                     first boot). An empty DB has no users and no broker
#                     accounts, so the scheduler cannot place orders. Safe to
#                     run while the Mac production process is still live.
#   live            - one-time restore of the production DB from the litestream
#                     R2 replica (guarded by a marker file on the volume), then
#                     run under `litestream replicate -exec` so PITR backup
#                     continuity is preserved. Flip to live ONLY after the Mac
#                     pm2 `trading` + `litestream` processes are stopped --
#                     otherwise two schedulers trade the same broker accounts.
#
# Requires NIXPACKS_PKGS="gnutar gzip" on the Coolify app (tar for the release
# tarballs; node/bash/coreutils are already in the nixpacks image).

# Pinned BACK from 0.5.14 (2026-07-10): 0.5.14 in this container churned ~20
# sockets/s to the R2 endpoint and held thousands of dead TCP socks (peak 16.8k
# fds on one PID, ~715MB of pinned receive buffers), driving the kernel to
# tcp_mem exhaustion -- every connection's receive window clamped to ~6KB, git
# clones from GitHub trickled at ~20KB/s and died mid-transfer ("TLS unexpected
# eof"), wedging ALL Coolify deploys on the box. All 0.5.x releases read/write
# the same LTX replica format, so moving within 0.5.x is replica-compatible
# (the 0.5.14 restore at cutover read history written by earlier 0.5.x).
# Re-upgrade only after upstream fixes the socket churn.
