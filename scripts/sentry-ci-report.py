"""
sentry-ci-report.py — reports CI workflow outcomes to the shared fleet-infra
Sentry project (org jays-services), via raw envelope HTTP (no sentry-sdk
dependency, no GitHub Actions marketplace action).

Invoked by .github/workflows/sentry-ci-report.yml, which listens for
`workflow_run: types: [completed]` across every other workflow in this repo
and sets the env vars this script reads. This script itself does not know
about GitHub Actions beyond reading those env vars — all the wiring lives in
the workflow file.

Two independent signals are sent per completed run:
  1. If conclusion == "failure": a Sentry error event tagged with
     {app, workflow, branch, actor}, carrying the run URL, fingerprinted on
     [app, workflow] so repeated failures of the same workflow in this repo
     group into one Sentry issue instead of paging separately every time.
  2. If the run was schedule-triggered (event == "schedule"): a Sentry Crons
     check-in (status "ok" on success, "error" otherwise) with an upsert
     monitor_config whose schedule mirrors that workflow's own cron
     expression (see CRON_SCHEDULES below) so a nightly/weekly job that
     silently STOPS running raises a missed-check-in alert.

The `app` tag + fingerprint component matter because fleet-infra is a SHARED
Sentry project: this repo and Congress.Trade both run workflows named "CI",
"Security", and "Effort Issues Sync", so without `app` a failure here would
dedup into the same Sentry issue as one there — and the titles ("CI workflow
failed: Security") gave no way to tell the two repos apart. Per AGENT-SYNC.md
"Observability", every event carries `app:<repo>`.

Branch is a TAG, never a fingerprint component. Merge-queue refs are unique per
attempt (`gh-readonly-queue/main/pr-1234-<sha>`), so fingerprinting on branch
minted a fresh throwaway Sentry issue for every queued run instead of grouping
them — the same failure mode that produced FLEET-INFRA-2N/-2H off agent
branches. Grouping is per (app, workflow); which branch broke is one tag click
away.

Secrets: SENTRY_FLEET_DSN is read only from the environment (set by the
workflow from the repo secret) and is NEVER printed or logged in any form,
including in exception messages.
