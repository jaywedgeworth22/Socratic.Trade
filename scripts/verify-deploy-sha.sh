# verify-deploy-sha.sh - assert that production is actually RUNNING a given commit.
#
# Merging to `main` auto-deploys `socratic-trade-prod` (AGENTS.md "Hosting & dev servers";
# docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-auto-deploy-on.md), but nothing in this repo ever CHECKED that the
# deploy landed. The app has published its own release identity on the PUBLIC liveness probe all
# along -- `/api/health` -> `.checks.release.sha`, produced by `runtimeReleaseIdentity()` in
# src/lib/runtime-health.ts -- and that field had zero consumers, so silent drift was invisible.
# On 2026-08-01 production was serving d456ca58 while origin/main was four commits ahead,
# including two code changes, and nothing anywhere noticed. This script is the missing assertion.
#
# It VERIFIES ONLY. It never triggers a deploy, never touches the Coolify API, and never posts a
# deploy claim -- auto-deploy on merge is the standing protocol and manual triggers/claims are
# explicitly retired. If this script fails, the fix is to investigate the webhook/build queue,
# not to hand-deploy.
#
# PREDICATE: "the live commit CONTAINS the expected commit" (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`), NOT
# "live sha == origin/main". A multi-agent fleet lands PRs continuously and builds serialize
# (`concurrent_builds=1`), so origin/main routinely advances past your merge while your own deploy
# is still building; strict equality would fail spuriously on every busy afternoon and the alarm
# would get ignored. Containment is the fact you actually care about: is my change live? It also
# makes the check safely cancellable -- if a newer commit is verified live, every earlier commit
# on main is live too.
#
# It reads the sha from the PUBLIC part of the payload and degrades gracefully if the field is
# absent (exit 2 with an actionable message) rather than silently passing. `null` is never a pass:
# nothing in this repo sets APP_RELEASE_SHA/SOURCE_COMMIT, so the value depends entirely on
# Coolify injecting one, and "unknown" must be as loud as "wrong".
#
# Exit codes -- each one is a different action for the operator:
#   0  live contains the expected commit: the deploy landed
#   1  operational error: bad usage, missing dependency, unresolvable ref, endpoint never answered
#   2  the live release sha is not exposed (null/absent): nothing can be verified
#   3  drift: live is BEHIND the expected commit when the poll window ran out
#   4  divergence: the live commit neither contains nor is contained by the expected commit
#   5  the live commit id is not an object in this repo, so it cannot be classified
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh                  # expect origin/main, poll up to 25 min
#   bash scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh <sha-or-ref>     # expect a specific merge commit
#   DEPLOY_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=0 bash scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh   # single shot, no polling
#
# Keep this file pure ASCII (AGENTS.md: operator shell scripts, Apple bash 3.2).
