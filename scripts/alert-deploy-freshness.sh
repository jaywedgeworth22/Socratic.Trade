# 2026-08-06 class: five Coolify deploys died mid-build (SSH exec stream exit 255)
# while GitHub webhooks returned 200 and /api/health stayed green on the OLD sha.
# Nobody noticed for ~14h. verify-deploy-sha.sh is the post-merge assertion (it
# polls up to 25 min). This script is the standing watchdog: one probe, then
# decide whether the lag is still a legitimate in-flight build or a freeze.
#
# Predicate: the OLDEST commit on expected that is not an ancestor of live is
# older than STALE_SECONDS (default 3600). Tip-age alone is wrong - a second
# merge 10 min ago would hide a first merge that has been stuck for hours.
#
# It VERIFIES ONLY. It never triggers a deploy, never touches Coolify, and never
# posts a deploy claim. A stale verdict means investigate the webhook / build
# queue (see .claude/skills/deploy-verify/SKILL.md), not hand-deploy.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  fresh enough (live contains expected, OR oldest undeployed is <1h)
#      Unreachable health is also 0 by default - UptimeRobot already pages
#      site-down; this watchdog is for the silent-green-on-old-sha class.
#   1  operational error (bad usage, missing git object, unexpected probe)
#   2  live release sha is null/absent
#   3  STALE: oldest undeployed commit is >= STALE_SECONDS old
#   4  live commit is divergent from expected
#   5  live commit id is not an object in this repo
#
