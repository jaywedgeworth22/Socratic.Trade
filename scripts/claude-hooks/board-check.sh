# Claude Code PreToolUse hook (Bash matcher): enforce the effort-log/handoff
# protocol at PUSH/LAND time, not every commit. Wired from the USER-level
# ~/.claude/settings.json (this repo keeps .claude/settings.json untracked,
# per-machine). Self-scoping: only acts in repos that track docs/EFFORT-LOG.md.
#
# Behavior: when the Bash command is a git push / scripts/land.sh / gh pr create
# and the current branch has NOT touched docs/EFFORT-LOG.md since forking from
# origin/main (and the file is not dirty in the working tree), DENY with the
# protocol checklist so the session fixes the boards first.
#
# Escape hatch: prefix the command with BOARD_CHECK_SKIP=1 (state why in your
# message). Fail-OPEN by design: any internal error allows the call -- this is
# a protocol nudge, not a security boundary.
#
# Added 2026-07-10 (owner-directed: "I have to remind you about agent-sync and
# effort log all the time"). See docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-fleet-procedure-skills.md.
