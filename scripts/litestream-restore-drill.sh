# Litestream restore drill — proves the CONTINUOUS replication tier can be restored.
#
# Restores the B2 replica to a scratch file, integrity-checks it, and compares row counts
# against the live database.  It never touches the live app.db and never writes to a
# replica.  Record the outcome in docs/rollouts/YYYY-MM-DD-litestream-restore-drill.md and
# on THE BOARD — a drill that was run but not written down will be run again next quarter
# by someone who cannot tell whether it ever passed.
#
# Cadence: quarterly, and after any Litestream version bump or litestream.coolify.yml change.
# Policy: docs/backup-policy.md.
#
# 2026-09-09: repointed at production.  This script previously defaulted to
# /Users/jay/apps/trading-live/, a Mac path that does not exist on any current machine, and
# described the replica as R2 — the active replica moved to Backblaze B2 in #2584.  It was
# therefore unrunnable as written, which is part of why the continuous tier has exactly one
# recorded restore proof (2026-08-18) and none since.
#
# WHERE TO RUN IT: on the HOST (fleet-hetzner-nbg1), NOT inside the app container.  Verified
# 2026-09-09: the host has `litestream` 0.5.16 at /usr/local/bin and `sqlite3` 3.46.1 at
# /usr/bin, both of which this script needs.  The runtime image has NEITHER — it ships no
# `sqlite3` CLI at all, and `coolify-prod-start.sh` downloads Litestream into
# /app/data/.bin and exports that PATH only for PID 1's process tree, which a later
# `docker exec` does not inherit.  A container invocation therefore dies at the
# `command -v litestream` guard, or at the first `sqlite3` call if PATH is patched by hand.
#
# CREDENTIALS: injected into the running Litestream process from Infisical; they are in no
# file and are NOT inherited by a fresh shell.  Export AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME / AWS_S3_ENDPOINT /
# AWS_REGION / AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY into this shell from a trusted
# source before running.  Do not echo them, and do not write them to a file that outlives
# the drill.
#
# For the R2 cold-archive tier the equivalent drill is
# scripts/ops/verify-cold-snapshot-restore.mjs, which uses the bundled better-sqlite3 and so
# needs no `sqlite3` CLI — that one DOES run inside the container.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/litestream-restore-drill.sh
#
# Required env (never pass secrets on argv):
#   AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME  AWS_S3_ENDPOINT  AWS_REGION
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# Optional:
#   LIVE_DB                  default /app/data/app.db
#   LITESTREAM_CONFIG        default /app/litestream.coolify.yml
#   SCRATCH_DIR              default /data/scratch  (needs ~1x the DB size; NOT a tmpfs)
#   RESTORE_PITR_TIMESTAMP   ISO 8601 point-in-time target, inside the 168h retention window
