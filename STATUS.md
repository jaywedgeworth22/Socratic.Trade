## Current (2026-08-13 GROK — Settings Saving… + ROIC Individual actually binds)

Owner: ROIC paid first tier (Individual) was set in Settings; dropdown snapped
back to Free for 20–30s with no busy state.  The save did land.  They want the
desk to show when a write is in flight, not look idle.

Optimistic plan-tier + Data Sources values; card Saving…/Saved; global Saving…
chip in the top bar for any console mutation.  Plan-tier lookup now reads the

## Current (2026-08-12 ~11:30pm CT GROK — SEC TTL was a 10-year pause; paid RAG knobs on)

Owner: is `SEC_FILING_INGEST_TTL_HOURS` too long, and run the clean-text reindex so every
advanced feature current tiers can run is on.

**Yes, it was too long — live Infisical was still `87600` (the 2026-08-10 emergency pause).**
Catalog default 168h was the old Voyage-free weekly pin.  Paid OpenRouter/bge-m3 wants 24h.
Claude had flipped the worker + max-per-run back on 2026-08-12 but left the 10-year TTL, so
`isFilingIngestDue` (one global last-attempt stamp) kept ingest dark.

Infisical prod now: TTL `24`, `VECTOR_EMBED_CLEAN_TEXT=on`, `RAG_MULTIQUERY=on`, `RAG_HYDE=on`,
`RAG_EMBED_DISCLOSURES=on`.  Worker already on; max-per-run stays 25.  Left off: FMP transcript
rights, full 8-K body, `VECTOR_ASOF_STRICT`.

Code (branch `grok/rag-advanced-enable`, worktree `~/apps/trading-grok-rag-enable`): catalog
default 24h; Settings user overrides now actually drive clean-text / multi-query / HyDE.
Reindex `POST /api/admin/reembed` after the queued main deploy picks up Infisical.  Do not

## Current (2026-08-12 ~9:20pm CT MONET - console false load-failure, phone-correct load graphic, iOS candlestick splash, Lato everywhere)

Owner-reported four-parter, all landed on `monet/loading-fonts`.  The headline is a real bug: the
console showed "Couldn't load the autonomy desk" on essentially every load while the iOS app on the
same account loaded fine.  Both clients call the SAME `getDashboardSnapshot`, so this was never a
server split - the console's 15s first-load watchdog SET `error`, and the shell rendered its
full-screen failure card on `error` alone, so any first load in the routine 15-24s band (the
server's own sequential broker-chain worst case) showed a failure screen while the request was
still in flight and about to succeed.  iOS has no such timer and simply waited.  Fixed via a new
pure `console-load-state.ts` ("an error while a fetch is still in flight is not a failure") with the
15s timer demoted to a reassurance line under the load screen; 7 regression tests - the rule was
untestable inside the React hook (node-only vitest, no jsdom), which is why it shipped.  Server-side
slowness itself is UNTOUCHED and remains the real follow-up: parallelising the sequential
accounts -> portfolio/positions/orders -> quotes chain.

Also: the intro canvas now measures the fixed overlay instead of `window.innerHeight` (they
disagree by 60-90px on iOS Safari, which pushed the chart down and clipped its low wicks on every
iPhone), DPR 3 on phones, iOS URL-bar resize absorption, safe-area-aware landing box.  iOS
`LaunchStateView` (icon + spinner + "Socratic.Trade") is now the candlestick SOCRATIC TRADE wordmark
at the top that slides away, sized by the web `MobileBrandRow` formula, plus a `LaunchBackground`
colorset that kills the white cold-launch flash.  Found and fixed a shipped bug along the way:
`CandleWordmarkView` rendered the wordmark VERTICALLY MIRRORED (S as 2, R as K, A as Y) from a
double row-flip in `alphaAt` - visible on the login screen in the current build.  Lato is now
self-hosted (deliberately NOT `next/font/google`: a build-time fetch would freeze auto-deploy) as
the site-wide default plus a named picker option, and bundled on iOS with Dynamic-Type-preserving
`.app*` twins across all 120 call sites.  Worth knowing: `--font-sans` named "Inter" but never
loaded it anywhere - no @font-face, no next/font, nothing in public/ - so the site had been
rendering in the device system font all along; Lato is the first real webfont it has ever resolved.

Gates: tsc clean, lint 0 errors, 6449 tests green, build clean, xcodebuild 40 iOS tests green.
Verified live, not just green: iOS simulator screenshots of the real launch sequence (that is how
the mirrored wordmark was caught), the built .app bundle inspected for font placement, and the
console load screen at 375x812 with Lato confirmed resolving at runtime.

attribution summing to 100, decision chain with a persistence-time validator), the
truncated-replay lookahead audit (weekly lane; momentum/liquidity + RAG evidence replayed with
history cut at decision time; honest unverifiable labels; 90-day windowed verdict), the PIT
fundamentals revision chain (restatements never rewrite history; as-of reads with a strict
knob), and keyless Polymarket prediction-market context in the strategist prompt.  All slices
adversarially verified; 13 integration fixes applied; full suite 6423 green + build clean before

`scoreHeadlineRelevance` rubric (`news-relevance.ts`, incl. the ambiguous-company-name
corroboration gate), keeps up to 3 currently-active company-relevant markets per symbol

fails open to no-data on any error.  Wired into `strategy.ts`'s `proposeTrades` at the same seam
`prompt-headlines.ts` and `getUpcomingEconomicEventsForPrompt` use — prompt-time only (candidates
entering the LLM call), never the scan-wide enrichment cascade, so it never fires on a

backtest.ts) + `db-lookahead-audit.ts` (migration 75, `lookahead_audit_findings`, deletion-covered):
a weekly durable per-user due-job samples matured `signal_snapshot` decisions past a watermark,
recomputes the momentum/liquidity factor sub-scores from daily OHLC truncated to each decision
date (through the existing pure `scoreFactors`, mirroring decision-time field availability via
per-field `sources` provenance), and replays RAG evidence by rebuilding the deterministic filings
query (now shared via `deterministicFilingsRetrievalQuery`; queryHash-guarded so builder drift
degrades to honest 'unverifiable') with asOf pinned + strictAsOf, diffing chunk ids against the
persisted candidate-pool `used:true` rows — Jaccard threshold for benign reranker drift, ANY
post-asOf chunk a hard mismatch.  value/quality/volatility/sentiment/positioning/diversification
are ALWAYS 'unverifiable' with stored backtestSafety receipts (the coverage gap is visible, never
silently implied clean); below 20 qualifying observations the aggregate verdict is an honest
'insufficient_sample'.  Advisory `lookahead_leak` notification fires on mismatch classifications

that RENDERS already-computed gate state (entry-drift, wash-sale, daily-cap, red-team,
dataAdjustments — never a new authority), four-bucket signal attribution summing to exactly 100,
and an append-only decision chain stamped at the existing override/human-approval sites with a
persistence-time validator that receipts (never drops) malformed chains.  Outcome engine now

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET - backup tier monitor: real coverage, previous version had none)

Branch `monet/backup-tier-monitor-real` (worktree `~/apps/trading-monet-tierfix`).

`assessLitestreamTierFreshness()` shipped 2026-08-11/12 claiming per-compaction-level backup
freshness for levels 0/1/2/3/9.  Verified on the live container today: it reported
`state: "unknown"` for ALL FIVE tiers on every health check - zero coverage, while presenting
itself as a five-tier breakdown.  Two independent causes:

1. It read local `<statePath>/ltx/<level>/`, but litestream 0.5.12 keeps ONLY level 0 on disk
   (`/app/data/.app.db-litestream/ltx/` has exactly one entry, `0`).  Levels 1/2/3/9 exist only
   in the B2 replica and could never be observed that way.
2. `ltx/0` holds 1,078 files; the shared scan returned `null` past a 256-entry bound, so even
   level 0 - the one readable level - degraded to "unknown".

The level-2 wedge it was built for was running the whole time (`compaction failed ...
non-contiguous transaction ids`; levels 1/2/3 frozen since 2026-08-08/10 while level 0 advanced).

Fixed by grading each level from a source that is actually valid: level 0 from local LTX in real
time, levels 1/2/3/9 from a new scheduled 30-minute remote replica inventory
(`src/lib/litestream-remote-inventory.ts`; `litestream ltx -level N -json`, never inline - the
`-level all` form measures 143s/14.1MB).  Anything else now reports an explicit
`state: "not-observable"` with a reason instead of a bare "unknown".  Degradation requires a
level to be past threshold AND behind level 0's txid, so an idle database cannot false-alarm.

Gates: tsc clean, lint 0 errors, `npm test` 6383 passed / 51 skipped (551 files), build passes.
Does NOT clear the underlying wedged level-2 compaction - still open ops work.

## Current (2026-08-12 CLAUDE - connection-health alert noise, root-caused)

Branch `claude/health-alert-noise` (worktree `/private/tmp/fx-st-health`).  Sentry carried ~28
distinct `"<name> connection failed"` issues, almost none of which were real outages.  Seven
verified causes fixed together, kept individually reviewable in the diff:

1. **Streak gate** - the alert gated on `lane.stoppedWorking`, which is ALSO set by two soft
   heuristics that a low-frequency lane's FIRST failure satisfies.  Now requires the hard
   `HEALTH_REASON_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` streak.
2. **Fingerprints** - pinned to stable lane ids so display-name drift stops fragmenting one lane
   into six issues.
3. **429 asymmetry** - RAG 429s now skip Sentry the way db-health always did; `alertUsageLimitHit`
   escalation intact.
4. **Re-probe loop** - all synthetic probe failures log soft, breaking alert -> 6h cooldown ->
   re-probe forever.
5. **Retired vendors** - FMP / Quiver / UW excluded from the alert path.
6. **Timeouts** - usage-monitor budget + knobs reads 2500ms -> 8000ms and soft-logged (both are
   fail-open).
7. **Local-fault mislabel** - `storeContexts` receipt/finalize SQLite faults attributed via a new
   cause-chain-walking `localDbFaultReason` instead of "RAG vector store failed".

congress.trade 502s (SOCRATIC-TRADE-B/8/1P) and the filingapi 401 (SOCRATIC-TRADE-1G) confirmed
still alerting, with explicit regression guards.  Rollout:

## Current (2026-08-12 CLAUDE — CI scripts: Sentry `app` tag + branchless fingerprint, effort-sync transport retry)

Two python-only CI-support fixes on branch `claude/ci-report-app-tag`
(worktree `/private/tmp/fx-st-ci`):

1. `scripts/sentry-ci-report.py` had no app identifier, so ST's events in the
   SHARED `fleet-infra` Sentry project deduped into Congress.Trade's
   identically-named workflow issues ("CI", "Security", "Effort Issues Sync").
   Adds `APP = "socratic-trade"` to the message, tags, and fingerprint.
   Fingerprint is now `[ci-failure, app, workflow]` — branch is a tag only,
   because merge-queue refs are unique per attempt and were minting a throwaway
   Sentry issue per queued run.
2. `scripts/sync-effort-issues.py` `http_request` caught only `HTTPError`, so
   today's `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` reaching api.github.com killed the
   whole run.  Adds bounded exponential-backoff transport retry for idempotent
   methods only — a `POST` is never replayed, since a truncated create response
   means the issue already exists and a retry would duplicate it.

Crons `monitor_slug` deliberately left un-namespaced: renaming orphans live
Sentry monitors, and there is no collision to fix.  Gates and a 15-check
behavioral harness recorded in the rollout note.

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET — iOS parity wave 3: cancel a working order from the phone)

Branch `monet/ios-order-cancel` (worktree `~/apps/trading-monet-wave3`).  Integration branch:
merges `monet/ios-parity-wave2` and `monet/order-cancel-server` (both clean, no conflicts) and
adds the iOS half of roadmap item #3 on top.

- Open orders were the phone's last see-but-cannot-act money surface.  `OrderRow` on the Assets
  screen now carries a **Cancel Order** button plus swipe-to-cancel, both opening the same
  confirmation dialog — the same ceremony the alert-delete row already uses.  No typed
  confirmation: the server requires none for cancel even on a live brokerage account, because
  cancelling prevents an execution rather than causing one.
- The control appears only on WORKING orders.  `OrderCancellation.isWorkingState` mirrors the
  server's `isWorkingOrderState` exactly (`ACTIVE_BROKER_ORDER_STATES` +
  `EXTRA_WORKING_ORDER_STATES`), so it matches the precondition `cancelWorkingOrder` enforces.
  `done_for_day` is excluded (terminal, but returned forever in Alpaca history); `pending_cancel`
  stays cancellable, matching the console — a stuck broker cancel is a reason to ask again.
- Payload `{ orderId, accountNumber }` where the account number is
  `readiness.selectedAccountNumber` — the server's stale-view guard, so a cancel queued while
  looking at one account cannot land on another.  Submitted through the normal `store.submit`
  path (busy guard + per-order idempotency key + snapshot reload); gated on the wave-2 control
  catalog so an older server hides the control instead of collecting a 400.

Round-2 review close-out (all three reviewer items closed; rollout §7):

- **The queued-loosening gap is CLOSED server-side.**  `policy.patch` now accepts an OPTIONAL
  `expectedCurrent` precondition — the same shape as `order.cancel`'s `expectedAccountNumber` —
  carrying the values the client believed were current for the fields it is patching.  Validated
  at queue time (scalar patchable fields only; unknown/wrong-typed/non-object is a 400) and
  compared at EXECUTION time before anything merges: a mismatch audits
  `mobile_policy_patch_precondition_mismatch` and throws `PolicyPatchPreconditionError` (409), so
  the whole patch is refused rather than partially or silently applied.  Without it, a tightening
  tapped against a $10,000 cap could execute as a LOOSENING minutes later, behind a draining
  `strategy.run_once`, if the console lowered that cap meanwhile.  A patch with NO
  `expectedCurrent` behaves exactly as before (proven by a test that performs the same mid-flight
  edit and asserts the legacy write still lands) — the web console is unaffected.  The iOS
  tightening UI now sends the precondition, so the "These controls only tighten" footer is true
  end to end.
- **Cancel is exempt from the >180 s snapshot-staleness gate**, like `account.activate`: a flaky
  connection is exactly when someone reaches for cancel, and the server re-validates
  (`requireWorkingOrder: true` -> 404/409), so a stale tap gets an honest error, never a wrong
  cancel.  Still requires a loaded snapshot and still respects the control catalog.
- **The deep-link focus ring is transient again** — it clears on any tab change and expires four
  seconds after the link lands, instead of marking one proposal card out for the whole session.

Verified: iOS 68/68 XCTests (56 merged base, +8 cancel, +2 round-1, +2 here), `npx tsc --noEmit`
clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors, full `npx vitest run` 6369 passed / 51 skipped (552 files).

Next: owner action only — TestFlight shipping.  Follow-ups: render the server's `dustWarning`
on the card after a cancel; replace-at-market from the phone.

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET — iOS parity wave 2: guardrail tightening, control catalog, universal links)

Branch `monet/ios-parity-wave2` (worktree `~/apps/trading-monet-wave2`).  Three items, all on
server capabilities that already exist:

1. **Tighten Guardrails** in the account/settings sheet — submits the existing `policy.patch`
   mobile command.  Autopilot -> Ask-First, and 75/50/25% reductions of `maxOrderNotional` /
   `maxDailyNotional`.  Tighten-only is a pure predicate (`PolicyTightening`), and it refuses
   entirely when a competing percent-of-NAV cap is stored, because the server's
   `normalizeExclusivePolicyCaps` would delete that cap and change which rule binds.  No new
   confirmation ceremony: same weight as Close Only / Wind Down.
2. **`snapshot.catalog` decoded** (`mobileControlCatalog()`), gating non-protective commands
   through `MobileStore.serverAdvertises`.  Missing catalog or empty `commands` falls back to
   the app's built-in controls; protective halts are never catalog-gated.
3. **Universal links + deep-link routing** — the app's first `onOpenURL`.
   `https://socratictrade.com/console/{approvals,approvals/<id>,orders,watchlist,activity}`
   routes to the matching tab (reusing the existing More-stack rerouting for unpinned tabs);
   `socratictrade://` stays auth-callback-only.  Entitlement + `project.yml` claim
   `applinks:socratictrade.com`; the domain half is `app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association/
   route.ts`, added to middleware `PUBLIC_PREFIXES` so Apple's anonymous fetch is not redirected
   to /login.

Verified: iOS 56/56 XCTests (was 37), `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, new vitest file green,
`npm run build` clean (AASA prerendered static).

Next: owner action — no App Store Connect / Apple credential work was performed; the associated
domain only takes effect once a build carrying the entitlement ships.

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET — mobile `order.cancel` command, server side)

Roadmap item #3, server half.  The phone could see working orders (`/api/mobile/snapshot` already
filters by `isWorkingOrderState`) but could not kill one.  Now it can.

- The console's cancel logic was extracted out of `app/api/orders/cancel/route.ts` into
  `src/lib/order-cancel.ts` (`cancelWorkingOrder`), so mobile runs the SAME path — lease-interleave
  receipt, time-bounded cancel-dust advisory, `order_cancel` audit, dashboard event, dust
  notification — instead of a second implementation drifting against the gateway.  The route is now
  the HTTP shell; console behaviour is unchanged and its three existing route tests pass untouched.
- New mobile command `order.cancel`, payload `{ orderId, accountNumber? }`.  Immediate (bypasses the
  sequential worker, so it cannot land behind a 30-minute `strategy.run_once`) but deliberately NOT
  protective — it must not cancel the operator's other queued work the way stop/close_only do.
- No typed confirmation: cancelling closes risk, it does not open it.
- Account isolation: every cancel is scoped to the requesting user's own selected account through
  their own credentials; a caller-named account that is not the selected one is refused before any
  broker I/O (`order_cancel_account_mismatch`), and the mobile lane additionally resolves the order
  in that account first (fail-open on an unavailable read, receipted).
- Replace-at-market is NOT included; requirements for it are listed in the rollout note.

Round 2 of the owner's external-repo lessons request (broad sweep: TradingAgents, ai-hedge-fund,
freqtrade, qlib, RD-Agent, FinMem).  Three definitive wins land in this PR, each built by a
dedicated agent, adversarially verified, and integration-fixed:

1. **Opt-in benchmark-alpha outcome grading** (`policy.outcomeGradingMode`, default raw,
   byte-identical): alpha mode grades decisions against SPY over the same window, cites alpha in
   the post-mortem prompt, writes divergence receipts (raw won / alpha lost = beta-not-skill),
   and keeps an :alpha stat ledger in retrieval-usefulness weighting.
2. **Live signal-health monitor**: daily lane computing rank IC of the LLM's own confidence vs
   matured outcomes (90-day window), quantile buckets, top-K churn, gross-vs-net; edge-triggered
   drift alarms via notify(); optional auto-throttle knob (default OFF); Signal Health card on
   Results (migration 74 — first migration shipping under the new BEGIN IMMEDIATE boot path).
3. **Cancel-dust advisory** (advisory ONLY, never blocks): partial-fill cancels that would
   strand a below-broker-minimum fragment warn in the cancel sheet + audit; pre-fetch is
   time-bounded so the emergency cancel lever can never wait on a hung broker read.

PR #2652's auto-deploy failed (deployment pyqxv16i): the incoming container crash-looped on
SQLITE_BUSY loading the instrumentation hook and Coolify rolled back (prod stayed up on the old
build).  Root cause: runMigrations used better-sqlite3's default DEFERRED transaction — under a
rolling deploy the outgoing container commits continuously, and the WAL snapshot upgrade throws
an instant SQLITE_BUSY that busy_timeout does not cover.  Fix: apply migrations via BEGIN

## Current (2026-08-12 ~6:20am CT CLAUDE — symbol drawer everywhere + iOS fills redesign)

Owner requests: ticker/logo clicks open the Market Scan company drawer on every surface
("all aspects of the site anywhere really"), and the iOS Activity fill cards get bolder/larger
text + a denser layout (screenshot critique).  Branch `claude/ui-symbol-drawer-fills`.

Web: closed every remaining un-wired symbol render (order cancel/replace sheets, live-approve
sheets, decisions rows via a stretched-link restructure, admin data-catalog + rag-coverage with
SymbolDrawerProvider newly mounted in the admin layout).  Fixed a real crash the sweep exposed:
SymbolDrilldownSheet's unconditional useConsoleData() throw outside the console shell — new
useConsoleDataOptional(), with an honest "not available here" exposure state.  Mobile PWA
deferred honestly (drawer depends on con-* tokens the PWA does not load).

iOS: FillActivityRow/CommandActivityRow typography bumped (ticker title3 bold, notional title3
semibold, date footnote) with tighter AppCard padding; new SymbolInfoSheet (same /api/quote
cascade as the web drawer) tappable from fills, positions, orders, watchlist, flow chips,
alerts, and proposals; 44pt remove target restored; derived marketCap removed (no fabrication).

Verified: tsc/lint/targeted vitest green; xcodebuild green (incl. post-merge with #2647 tabs +

## Current (2026-08-12 ~5:40am CT CLAUDE — dsa-lessons round 1: digest, relevance, receipts)

Owner asked for lessons from ZhuLinsen/daily_stock_analysis (62k-star LLM stock-analysis repo),
then broadened to a moderately broad GitHub sweep.  Research ran as two 15-agent workflows
(readers -> synthesis -> per-lesson gap analysts); full verdicts + sketches in
`docs/reviews/2026-08-12-dsa-lessons-gap-analysis.md`.  This lane (branch `agent/claude`) lands
round 1 — three implemented lessons, each built + adversarially verified + integration-fixed:

1. **Opt-in daily watchlist digest** (default OFF; Settings -> Delivery): typed report context
   (latest persisted scan quote + proposal trajectory per symbol) -> full/medium/brief renderers ->
   notify() `bodyTiers` picking the largest tier per channel via new `CHANNEL_CAPABILITIES`
   (also retires the latent pushover/ntfy truncation gap).  New `trade_proposals.symbol` column
   + index (migration + backfill).  Fires once per CT day at/after 15:15 CT via a watermark lane.
2. **News entity-relevance gating** (default ON, real off-switch via `NEWS_RELEVANCE_*` knobs):
   AV `relevance_score` and Marketaux `match_score` were documented-but-discarded — now parsed and
   gated (match_score normalized /100 — it was ~12-82, making the 0-1 knob inert until the
   integration fix); leaf rubric `news-relevance.ts` with ambiguous-company-name corroboration;
   stream path drops only zero-evidence associations on multi-symbol articles.
3. **Proposal repair-ladder receipts** (money-path, surgical): `TradeProposal.dataAdjustments`
   kind-prefixed receipts; deterministic session-vs-phrasing guard (never blocks/rewrites);
   `confidenceCapDataDegraded` tuning knob; existing bracket-fallback disclosures now also write
   receipts; approval card renders them.

Gates: lint 0 errors; tsc clean; targeted suites 76/76; full test+build via land.sh at push.
Next: round-2 implementation (benchmark-alpha grading, signal-health monitor, cancel-dust
advisory) on this lane after merge; UI lane (`claude/ui-symbol-drawer-fills`) lands separately.
Blockers: none.

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET — iOS parity wave 1: decision-critical fields, protective controls, swipe actions, admin portal)

**Branch `monet/ios-parity-wave1`** (stacked on `monet/ios-customizable-tabs`, PR #2647): First
wave of the iOS parity roadmap — all zero-backend, rendering already-decoded snapshot data and
dispatching existing command types.  (1) Proposal cards now show price drift (reference → current
price with signed %), last revalidation time, and the Red Team failure kind when the verdict is
unavailable (console `describeRedTeamFailureKind` wording).  (2) Home gains Close Only + Wind Down
protective controls beside Stop (`strategy.close_only` / `strategy.liquidating`, same
CommandButton/store.submit pattern, no added ceremony).  (3) `policy.runDuringExtendedHours` is now
decoded and a pure `deriveRunStateWord` mirrors the console's `deriveStateInfo` vocabulary — the
app can no longer say "Running" while the console says "Paused · market closed" (7 new XCTests).
(4) Swipe-to-reject on proposal cards (reject ONLY, never approve) and swipe-to-delete on alert
rows via a new ScrollView-compatible `swipeRevealAction`; watchlist swipe skipped (chip grid, not
rows — one-tap remove already exists).  (5) Triggered alerts show `triggeredAt`/`triggeredPrice`.
(6) Account sheet rows show capabilities + draining state.  (7) New `AdminPortalView` (admin-only
row) hosts /admin in a navigation-fenced WKWebView with native-session cookie handoff.  28/28
tests pass.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-12-ios-parity-wave1.md`.

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET — iOS customizable tab bar + xcodegen version-regression root cause)

**Branch `monet/ios-customizable-tabs`:** The iOS app's tab bar is now owner-customizable with
the exact web mobile-tabs semantics (`app/console/lib/mobile-tabs.ts` parity: pin/unpin, min 2 /
max 4, canonical-order bar, always-present More surface keeping every screen reachable), using
the native system `TabView` so the Liquid Glass appearance is preserved.  Programmatic tab jumps
to unpinned screens reroute into the More stack.  8 new XCTests pin the contract.  Along the
way, found and killed the ROOT CAUSE of the 2026-08-11 version regression: `xcodegen generate`
was rewriting Info.plist's version keys to literal `1.0`/`1` because `project.yml` never
declared them — now declared as `$(MARKETING_VERSION)`/`$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` so any
future regen preserves substitution.  A parallel expert-panel workflow is reviewing web↔iOS
parity and reports separately.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-12-ios-customizable-tabs.md`.

## Current (2026-08-11 MONET — litestream per-tier backup status: health check + admin panel)

**Branch `monet/backup-status-panel` (committed locally, not pushed — see rollout note for why).**
Tonight's litestream incident (stuck level-1 B2 compaction anchor, silently wedged 27+ hours —
see the escalation trail above and `docs/rollouts/2026-08-09-event-loop-stall-instrumentation.md`)
exposed a real gap: `checks.storage.litestream*` on `/api/health` only ever observes level 0
(continuous sync) via the IPC socket, so it would NOT have caught this. Added: (1)
`assessLitestreamTierFreshness()` in `src/lib/runtime-health.ts` — per-compaction-level (0/1/9)
freshness via local `ltx/<level>/` file mtimes, with documented thresholds (10min/4h/30h) and a
graceful "unknown" state everywhere litestream isn't configured this way; (2) wired additively
into `checks.storage.litestreamTiers` on `/api/health` (existing fields untouched) + folds into
`storageDegraded` + per-tier `alertStorageWarning`; (3) new admin panel `app/admin/backups/` (nav
entry "Backup Status") showing Continuous Sync / Compaction / Daily Snapshot per-tier health,
backed by new admin route `app/api/admin/backup-status/route.ts`; (4) tests in
`test/runtime-health.test.ts` (unit), `test/connection-health-routing.test.ts` (integration,
reproduces the exact incident shape against the real route), `test/backup-status-route.test.ts`
(new, admin route). `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors, targeted vitest run (57
tests across the 4 touched/related files) green. Full `npm test`/`npm run build` run before
commit — see the rollout note for final counts. Does NOT fix the underlying stuck B2 anchor
itself (that's separate ops work, still open). Rollout:

## Current (2026-08-12 ANTIGRAVITY — OSS lessons, Strategy ID fixes, & Dashboard additions)

1. **Bug fixes**:
   - Fixed `proposalId` loop re-assignment in `src/lib/strategy.ts` (Issue #2593) which caused orphaned receipts.
   - Applied `roundCents` to `bracketForm` in `src/lib/tradier.ts` (Issue #2578) to fix sub-penny bracket routing.
   - Verified that `onClick` was already correctly implemented for account deletion in `MobileHomeTab.tsx` (Issue #2592).
2. **Dashboard Features**:
   - Added `MarketAnalysisCard` in `app/console/page.tsx` to display macro regime and market breadth.
3. **Documentation**:
   - Updated `docs/oss-lessons.md` with integration learnings from `daily_stock_analysis`.

**Verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` clean (fixed 1 let->const error), `npm test` clean, `npm run build` clean.

## Previous (2026-08-11 ANTIGRAVITY — Desktop Web & Mobile PWA UX Enhancements)

**Branch `ag/desktop-mobile-ux-enhancements`:**
1. **Desktop Web UX**:
   - `command-palette.tsx`: Added global hotkeys (`Cmd+K`/`Ctrl+K` command palette toggle, `A` Proposals jump, `R` strategy run-once dispatch, `1-6` tab navigation). Added `<kbd>` badges and `action:run-once` command item.
   - `approval-card-skeleton.tsx` & `portfolio-overview-skeleton.tsx`: Created animated pulse skeleton loading components matching approval cards and portfolio overview metrics.
   - `console.css`: Synchronized `.dark` design token values with `app/globals.css`.
2. **Mobile Web PWA UX**:
   - Refactored `mobile-pwa-client.tsx` into modular components under `app/mobile/components/` (`MobileHeader.tsx`, `MobileNavBar.tsx`, `MobileHomeTab.tsx`, `MobileProposalsTab.tsx`).
   - Implemented `usePreventScrollChaining` hook for WebKit boundary top check (`scrollTop === 0` set to `1`) and CSS `overscroll-behavior-y: contain` to prevent iOS Safari body scroll chaining.
3. **Verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` clean (0 errors), `npm test` (83 files / 739 tests passed), `npm run build` clean.

## Current (2026-08-12 ~12:20am CT MONET — new app icon: dollar-sign candlesticks)

Owner supplied a reference image (3D-rendered candlesticks arranged as a "$", green/pink
palette, light gray grid background) and asked for it as the app icon with a lightened
background. Replaced `ios/SocraticTrade/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon-1024.png`
(previously a "ST" wordmark built from candlesticks) with a processed version of the owner's
image: background lightened via a saturation-based blend (candlestick colors untouched, smooth
ramp rather than a hard threshold to avoid speckling in the soft-shadow areas), resized to the
required 1024x1024, confirmed opaque RGB (no alpha — required for App Store icons). Single-file
change, no other icon sizes to update (this appiconset uses Xcode's unified single-size format).
## Current (2026-08-12 ~12:08am CT MONET — litestream reset executed; leak appears resolved, monitoring continues)

Escalation trigger from the previous entry fired (kill gap compressed to 5m35s). Owner approved
proceeding. Executed the previously-planned fix: `docker stop` (clean, 30s), cleared the local
litestream LTX metadata directly on the host volume path (`litestream reset`'s documented effect
— never touches the DB file or B2), Coolify `start` (image reused, no rebuild). ~6 min outage.
Post-restart: litestream started with zero errors (previously every fresh start hit a checksum
mismatch within 2-3 min, without exception), memory at 374MiB ~4 min in (previous fresh starts
were multi-GB by this point). Strong early signal, NOT yet confirmed as fixed — several hours of
clean operation spanning a level-9 snapshot cycle is the real bar. Full detail + what to check if
it recurs: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-09-event-loop-stall-instrumentation.md` ("Fix executed" section,
bottom).

## Current (2026-08-11 MONET — iOS version regression fix)

PR #2637 accidentally hardcoded `ios/SocraticTrade/Info.plist`'s `CFBundleShortVersionString`
to the literal `"1.0"` and `CFBundleVersion` to `"1"`, replacing what used to be
`$(MARKETING_VERSION)`/`$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` build-variable substitution. This silently
broke the owner's version regimen (App Store "Version" goes 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2 per release,
separate from the internal build number): bumping `MARKETING_VERSION` in the Xcode project would
no longer have actually changed what ships. Restored both fields to variable-substitution form
and set `MARKETING_VERSION`=1.0.1 / `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`=2 in both `project.pbxproj`
(Debug+Release) and `project.yml` — this is the first build after 1.0.0/1.0 already shipped to
TestFlight. `preferredProjectObjectVersion`/`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` from #2637 left untouched
(legitimate fixes, not part of this regression). Rollout:
`docs/rollouts/2026-08-11-ios-version-regimen-fix.md`.

## Current (2026-08-11 ANTIGRAVITY — System Audit & iOS Resiliency Rollout)

**Branch `agent/antigravity-review`:** Top-to-bottom audit across Desktop Web, Mobile Web (PWA), iOS App (SwiftUI), Backend Pipelines (SEC EDGAR ingest, RAG vector engine), Database Concurrency, Latency Monitoring, and Competitor Benchmarking. Artifact `implementation_plan.md` created; review note `[ST, Antigravity] Comprehensive System Audit & Improvements` created and pinned in Apple Notes (folder `Coding`). Native iOS client updated with exponential backoff retry loop (`MobileAPIClient.swift`) and raw JSON disk caching (`MobileStore.swift`) for instant `<50ms` offline startup. All gates verified green (Xcode build, tsc, lint, vitest). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-11-system-audit-and-ios-resiliency.md`.

## Current (2026-08-11 ~9:40am CT MONET — litestream kill cadence ACCELERATING: 51→78→49→20→19 min gaps)

Since the root-cause deploy below, 6 more OOM kills logged (all `exitCode=137`, all auto-recovered
in ~1s, site health unaffected each time). The gap between kills has compressed from ~50-80 min
down to ~19-20 min over the last 3 cycles — consistent with the confirmed root cause (the stuck B2
compaction anchor persists in the replica's own state across restarts, so un-compacted WAL keeps
growing across the whole incident, not per-container). **Escalation trigger set:** if the gap
compresses under ~10 minutes, stop deferring to "daylight" and actively clear the stuck B2
generation now (see next steps in the rollout note) regardless of local time. Full timeline +
reasoning: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-09-event-loop-stall-instrumentation.md` (escalation section,
bottom).

## Current (2026-08-11 ~4:30am CT MONET — litestream leak root cause CONFIRMED, not yet fixed)

The all-night litestream OOM-leak (open since 2026-08-09) has a confirmed root cause now, not
just a hypothesis: litestream's B2 replica is stuck compacting from txid `2324d` — every retry's
multipart upload fails with `file checksum mismatch` on close (~every 100s), the anchor never
advances, so each retry re-uploads a larger accumulated range, which is why memory climbs and why
peak-per-kill severity keeps growing (2.05→4.82GB across 9 kills so far). No existing kill-switch
applies (the only one is R2-specific and explicitly no-ops on B2). Site serving health remains
unaffected throughout (Docker `restart: unless-stopped` recovers every crash in seconds) — this
is not an outage, but the leak itself remains open. Full evidence + next steps for daylight fix:

## Current (2026-08-11 MONET — server-metrics panel repair + canonical Oracle→Hetzner doc correction)

**No branch (config + docs, direct on `main` — repo-side changes on `monet/*`, see below):**
ST's admin server-stats panel was fully broken (`degraded: true, stale: true`, Coolify 401 +
Hetzner 404×2) because `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` — and therefore this session's own initial
answer to the owner — had never caught up with the 2026-08-07 emergency cutover off Oracle Cloud
(Oracle suspended the account without reason, `docs/rollouts/2026-08-06-ios-login-522-oracle-down.md`)
to a brand-new Hetzner box (`docs/rollouts/2026-08-07-hetzner-fleet-cutover.md`). Three stale
values found and corrected: `HETZNER_SERVER_ID` (wrong box) and `COOLIFY_SERVER_UUID` (wrong
UUID) in ST's Infisical, plus a dead 401 `COOLIFY_SERVER_STATS` token in BOTH ST's Infisical and
the `~/.secrets/global-api-keys.env` handoff file (fixed from the box's own dedicated, working,
read-only-scoped token at `/root/.coolify-api-token-stats` — deliberately did NOT substitute the
broader `COOLIFY_AGENTS` token, preserving the read-only/admin scope separation). Panel verified
fully live post-fix: `degraded: false, stale: false, cacheAgeSeconds: 0`, real resources
(`socratic-app`, `congress-trade`, `usage-monitor`). `AGENTS.md`'s hosting section rewritten to
lead with the real current host: `167.233.254.55` / `fleet-hetzner-nbg1` / Hetzner `cx43` (8 vCPU
AMD EPYC-Rome, 16 GB RAM, 160 GB NVMe) / Coolify server UUID `jxzqcs3h6g1wiipnnblhismp` / Hetzner
hardware serial `159792099`. UM's own panel not independently re-verified (no admin credential
available this session) — UM's hardcoded fallback defaults already match the correct live
values, so it should work unless UM's own Infisical has a stale explicit override. Rollout:

Shipped warn-only timeSync wrappers (extractFilingText / tradeHighlightChunksFromText / chunkDocument) + yieldEventLoop between filings/tasks.

**Branch `monet/sec-worker-edgar-403`:** minutes after the trial knobs + full-universe seed went
live, every SEC ingest worker fetch 403'd (`www.sec.gov/Archives`), dead-lettering ~50 tasks.
Root causes: worker fetched with NO User-Agent (SEC hard-403s undeclared tools; the refresh lane
passes UA explicitly and kept working), prod lacked `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT` (now set in Infisical),
secLimiter only reacted to 429 (SEC signals blocks with 403), and the worker burned stage attempts
into an IP-level block. Fixes: UA auto-injection for `.sec.gov` in `politeFetch`; `report403()`
global cooldown (`SEC_403_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`, default 600s) + `pausedUntilIso()`; worker defers
(attempt refunded, `edgar_403_deferred`) instead of failing; `requeueSecIngestDeadLetters` + admin

## Current (2026-08-09 MONET — trial knobs LIVE in prod + EDGAR shard-field fix)

**Branch `monet/sec-shard-field-fix`:** the trial knob set from the throughput audit is now
APPLIED in prod (Infisical + Coolify restart; all 7 values verified in the serving process env):
delay 0ms, batch 32, texts/day 250k, WU/day 2.5M, SEC per-run 200, TTL 6h, ingest worker ON.
`data/rag-universe-manifest.json` copied onto the prod data volume (the `/app/data` volume mount
shadows the image's `data/`, so the seeder 500'd ENOENT). First full-universe seed then exposed a
real bug: `SubmissionsJson.filings.files[]` used invented field names `filingStart/filingEnd`;
real EDGAR shards carry `filingFrom/filingTo`, so the shard-pagination sort threw
`undefined.localeCompare` and aborted the seed (test fixture had the same wrong names — suite
green, prod broken). Fixed with real names + `?? ""` guard. Re-seed after this deploys. Rollout:
`docs/rollouts/2026-08-09-trial-knobs-applied-and-edgar-shard-fix.md`. Next: re-run seed, watch

## Prior (2026-08-09 MONET — Pinecone trial throughput audit + monthly WU pace guard)

**Branch `monet/pinecone-trial-maximize` (commit-only; landing operator lands):** owner wants the
Pinecone Standard trial used close to full extent, then a drop to free/$20 without a repeat of the
hourly-429 mess. (A) Throughput audit — every ingest limiter inventoried with TRIAL vs AFTER values
for the owner to apply in Infisical (no secrets read/written). Headline: `VECTOR_EMBED_BATCH_DELAY_MS`
(default 21s, a Voyage-3-RPM artifact) is applied unconditionally between embed batches and pins
ingest at ~1,371 chunks/h even on OpenRouter bge-m3 — the single biggest lever. OpenRouter embed
spend is NOT the constraint (~$0.0013 per 1k chunks); post-trial Pinecone STORAGE is. (B) New
`src/lib/pinecone-monthly-pace.ts` — persisted calendar-month WU counter (fed from
`meterPineconeUpsert`, resets on month roll), linear month-end projection with a 0.2 elapsed floor
(mirrors `r2-usage.ts`), `PINECONE_MONTHLY_WU_BUDGET` default 0 = OFF. When projected pace exceeds
the budget the SEC ingest **backfill queue** stops claiming new tasks; incremental filing ingest and
all retrieval are structurally un-gated. ONE advisory + audit per calendar month. Number exposed at
`/api/admin/rag-coverage` → `providerUsage.pinecone.monthlyWriteUnitPace` even when off. Gates: tsc
clean; 12 test files / 162 tests green (new `test/pinecone-monthly-pace.test.ts` 10/10); lint 0

## Current (2026-08-09 MONET — "Pinecone connection failed / database is locked" mislabel)

**Branch `monet/pinecone-lock-mislabel` (commit-only; landing operator lands):** the hourly
owner-visible push titled "Pinecone connection failed" with body `inventory fetch: database is
locked` was OUR SQLite, not Pinecone. Root cause: `settleProviderDispatch`
(`src/lib/db-provider-dispatch.ts`) opened a DEFERRED transaction that SELECTs before it UPDATEs,
so promoting the WAL read snapshot to a write returns `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT` ("database is
locked") instantly WITHOUT consulting `busy_timeout` — which is why the 60s ceiling never absorbed
it; every ledger transaction now opens `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (repro receipts in the rollout note).
Second fix: new `src/lib/local-db-fault.ts` classifies local-SQLite failure signatures, and
`withRagApiHealth` no longer writes a provider failure row or a `provider_degraded` push for them —
it records a `local_db_contention` audit row and, past 5 occurrences in 6h, ONE advisory titled
"Storage Warning: local database contention" (never a vendor name); `alertConnectionFailure` gets
the same guard for non-RAG lanes. Real Pinecone HTTP/network errors behave exactly as before.
Gates: tsc clean; 22 test files / 236 tests green (new `test/local-db-fault-classification.test.ts`

`storeContextsImpl` persists each paid vector (Float32 BLOB, keyed
content_hash-of-embed-input + model + embed-rev) AFTER provider validation and BEFORE the
Pinecone upsert; upsert success deletes the rows (managed commits defer to after
markCommitted); upsert failure keeps them and every retry path replays them with ZERO provider
calls — durable across restarts. WU-breaker gate still blocks everything (incl. stage-consume)
until it lifts; stage replays on resume. Retention: 35d orphan sweep + 2 GiB oldest-first cap in
the daily audit-prune lane. Receipts: `embed_stage_replay` audit (embeds avoided per store call),
`embedsFromStage` on results + lastIngest. Gates: tsc clean; 33 test files / 376 tests green

`withRagApiHealth` trips a marker (`pinecone:wuExhaustedUntil` = 1st of next month UTC,
ONE storage_warning + audit, health row soft `[expected-limit]`), early gate in
`storeContexts`/`storeDocument` refuses writes BEFORE any embed spend

## Current (2026-08-08 MONET — review-fix wave E: owner mobile punch list)

**Branch `monet/review-fixes-e` (isolated worktree, commit-only — landing operator lands):**
owner iPhone-Safari punch list. New owner-wide `SENTENCE_GAP` (NBSP+space) sentence separator
applied to this wave's copy; Proposals empty state merged to one paragraph naming the ⚡
lightning Run-once button; Orders header de-chipped (env + account chips duplicated the top
banner) with Refresh on the h1 row and a merged intro; mobile tab bar restored to
`bottom:0` + env(safe-area-inset-bottom) only (the 2026-08-05 chrome-gap shift itself hid the
labels under Safari's URL chrome and its ≥48px underlay was the grey buffer — reverted);
Positions weight is now the UNSIGNED share of gross exposure (kills "-0.0%" short artifacts;
fmtPct never renders negative zero); Orders LAST PRICE gains a durable `symbol_field_latest`
final fallback (`orderPriceFallbacks` on the snapshot, age-tagged "· 23h old") and the mobile
card label is one-line "Last". Gates: tsc clean; 12 test files / 161 tests green; lint 0
errors. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-08-review-fixes-e-mobile-punchlist.md`.

## Prior (2026-08-06 MONET full-product review + deploy-freeze repair)


## Production host (2026-08-07)

**Hetzner** `167.233.254.55` (Coolify + all apps). ST live with L9 repaired DB. CT/UM live on fresh schema. See `docs/rollouts/2026-08-07-hetzner-fleet-cutover.md`.

**MONET (this seat; posts earlier today were tagged CLAUDE before the owner re-ruled the seat) ran the owner-requested full-product review** (live signed-in prod session +
12-agent workflow): findings in `docs/reviews/2026-08-06-claude-full-product-review.md`,
handoff in `docs/rollouts/2026-08-06-claude-full-product-review.md`, issues labeled
`product-review-2026-08-06`. Highest-urgency discoveries:

- **Deploy freeze (P0): all five 2026-08-06 deploys failed** — Coolify's SSH exec stream
  dies mid-build (exit 255, "disconnected by user"), correlated with CT OCR load on the
  shared box; prod sat on `6b47a886` while main advanced 4 merges. Zombie helper
  `onlrw5mgf4s2pw9he4udt2kg` (13.5h) removed; webhook redelivered; retry on a quiet box
  progressed past every earlier failure point (see rollout note for final status).
- **Litestream→R2 was PAUSED (P0)** since Aug 4 (free-tier kill-switch). **Superseded
  2026-08-07 GROK:** active replica → **Backblaze B2** (see Current header); R2 left
  historic. Cross-app R2 free-tier noise may still alert but must not stop B2 backups.
- **Results page shows +56.47% vs SPY on a flat account (P1)** — phantom inferred
  $36.5k withdrawal + SPY series silently 0.00% everywhere; and the tax open-lots ledger
  contradicts live positions (T long 91 sh vs actual short −1.881). Overlaps GROK's
  `grok/fix-account-return-pct`.
- **Two unmanaged shorts (P1)**: PG/T shorts sit unprotected because every enforcement
  layer skips shorts while `shortSellingEnabled` is off (`app/console/lib/derive.ts`).
- **Shared-package drift (P1)**: manifest pins `congress-trading-shared#v2.5.1`, lockfile
  ships 2.5.0 — the filingDate member-skill dependency is not actually deployed.

## 2026-08-05 GROK — multi-period TWR

## 2026-07-06 — Learned-context copy fix + browse/delete archive (CLAUDE, `agent/claude`)
Owner flagged awkward empty-state copy on the Learned Context approval queue and asked why the AI
doesn't auto-learn and let the user review/delete afterward. Answer: it mostly already does — the
`fact` tier is silent passthrough, never queued; only `risk`/`strategy-directive` (numeric limits,
sizing, leverage, authority) confirms first, and that's deliberate (ingested-document/inference
safety, not paternalism — see `docs/chat-multiuser-learning-design.md`). What was genuinely
missing: the "browse + delete what was silently learned" surface the design doc promised but never
built. Shipped both: reworded the empty-state copy; added `deleteLearnedContext` (ownership-scoped,
also the shared-contribution erasure path) in `src/lib/db-learning.ts`, new `GET
/api/learned-context` + `DELETE /api/learned-context/[id]` routes, client helpers, and a new
collapsed-by-default `LearnedFactsArchive` browse/delete component in
`app/console/approvals/learned-context.tsx` wired into the approvals page. New
`test/learned-context-delete.test.ts` (7 tests: ownership isolation, foreign-user 404, shared-row
erasure, audit trail, superseded-row exclusion). 8-angle adversarial review found no
correctness/security bugs (two correctness-adjacent candidates investigated and refuted with
concrete evidence — see rollout note). Branch had drifted far behind `origin/main`
(Coolify/Hetzner migration, mobile fixes, RAG/sizing/prompt-safety work); merged by hand after
reviewing every flagged overlap, re-verified full quartet on the merged tree: tsc clean, lint 0
errors, 283 files / 2843 tests green, build clean. **Merged as PR #998** (`1c0c20d3`).
**Deployed to production** 2026-07-06 21:30:29Z via `~/apps/trading-publish.sh` — verified
`/api/health` 200, `pm2 trading` stable (0 unstable restarts post-deploy), and the new

## Where things stand

**2026-08-04 — Multi-Source Quote Cascade & Staleness Resolution (ANTIGRAVITY).** Implemented a 5-level redundant quote cascade resolving active broker gateway → Alpaca snapshots → Yahoo batch → Yahoo single → ROIC.ai profile. Converted the quote staleness policy check into a non-blocking gate that mutates opening orders to limit orders to defend the price (buy capped at min(limit, ref), short capped at max(limit, ref)), appends warning text to rationale, writes a `quote_staleness_warn` audit trail, and alerts the user via `provider_degraded` push. Full tests and builds check out clean. Rollouts: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-multi-source-quote-cascade.md`, `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-non-blocking-quote-staleness-gate.md`.
**2026-08-04 — Multi-Source Quote Cascade & Staleness Resolution (ANTIGRAVITY).** Added a redundant multi-source quote cascade in `src/lib/quotes-cascade.ts` checking broker quotes, Alpaca snapshots, Yahoo batch, and Yahoo single quote APIs in series. Integrated it across the strategy run loop, proposal approvals, and chat draft promotion. Added a unit test suite to verify the cascade level routing. Full type check and lints pass. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-multi-source-quote-cascade.md`.

**2026-08-04 — EOD Quote History Cache SQLite Migration (ANTIGRAVITY).** Migrated the legacy flat-file JSON EOD quote caching (`data/history-5y/`, etc.) in `src/lib/history.ts` to a fully SQLite-backed table `history_cache_eod` to resolve test failures and ensure robust silent-caching. Replaced `fetchLocalFlatFileHistory` with `fetchHistoryCacheEod`. Updated the `test/history.test.ts` suite to seed the SQLite DB directly. Full tests pass. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-history-cache-eod-migration.md`.

**2026-08-03 — Subdomain Host Routing & EOD Quote Caching Upgrade (ANTIGRAVITY, branch `agent/antigravity`).** Added `mobile.socratictrade.com` $\rightarrow$ `/mobile` and `console.socratictrade.com` $\rightarrow$ `/console` host-level routing in `middleware.ts`. Upgraded EOD price history in `src/lib/history.ts`: added `isBarSeriesFresh` staleness detection, `mergeOHLCBars` merging for stale flat files, auto-persistence of fresh provider bars into SQLite `imported_price_eod` and disk, and `eod_cache_stale` audit logging. All gates green (`tsc`, `lint`, vitest 27/27, Next.js `build`). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-eod-quote-caching-and-subdomain-routing.md`.

**2026-08-03 — iOS/mobile account switch hangs (MONET, branch `monet/ios-account-switch-fix`).**
Owner screenshots: Roth IRA spinner stuck, Sandbox still Active, Home stale + 2 queued · 1
running. Root cause: `account.activate` waited on the global sequential mobile worker behind
`strategy.run_once`, and clients also blocked switch when the snapshot was stale. Fix: run
`account.activate` immediately (same path as stop), allow switch on stale snapshot (iOS + PWA),
clear iOS busy spinner from the terminal POST before snapshot reload. Focused mobile tests
16/16; full gates via land.sh. Rollout:
`docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-ios-account-switch-immediate.md`.
**2026-08-03 — Console RAG Evidence Card Deduplication (ANTIGRAVITY, branch `agent/antigravity/mobile-pwa-feedback`).** Fixed duplicate RAG evidence rendering (`sec-edgar` and `Retrieved 10 K` cards showing identical document receipt & score) in proposal drawer by deduplicating RAG attributions against `decision.evidence` in `deriveEvidenceRows` (`app/console/page.tsx`). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-dedupe-evidence-cards.md`.

**2026-08-03 — Console dashboard `topCandidates.slice` white-screen (GROK, branch
`agent/grok-fix-dashboard-topcandidates`).** Owner report: main `/console` showed
`Dashboard error` / `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'r.topCandidates.slice')`.
Root cause: `deriveEvidenceRows` assumed every truthy `latestScan` had array
`topCandidates`. Fix: `safeTopCandidates` + snapshot normalization in `dashboard.ts`.
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-console-topcandidates-slice-crash.md`.

**2026-08-03 — Xcode App Settings & Apple Sign-In Layout Constraint Fix (ANTIGRAVITY).** Configured Xcode App Category (`public.app-category.finance`), Display Name (`Socratic.Trade`), Marketing Version (`1.0.0`), and Build Version (`1`) across `Info.plist` and `project.pbxproj`. Fixed `ASAuthorizationAppleIDButton` layout constraint collision warning (`width == 392` vs `width <= 375`) in `LoginView.swift` by capping `SignInWithAppleButton` width to 375pt. `xcodebuild` succeeded clean. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-xcode-app-settings-and-apple-signin-constraint-fix.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Exit-0 outage root-caused + exit-code hardening (MONET, branch
`monet/exit0-outage-audit`).** The 15:29Z "clean exit 0, stayed down" outage was an
**unpaired docker-API stop**, with the 0 fabricated by a pid-1 signal-re-raise bug in the
infisical wrappers plus in-container npm swallowing SIGTERM (sandbox-reproduced in the
real image; every deploy had been hard-killing next-server). Fixed: wrappers exit 128+N,
boot script now supervises the app (spontaneous clean exit → 40, every exit logged,
`node_modules/.bin/next start` direct — npm banned from the exec chain), new
production-gated `src/lib/exit-guard.ts` re-tags spontaneous in-app exit(0) → 43 with
call-site receipts. Restart policy is already `unless-stopped` — evaluated, **no flip**
(it restarts any spontaneous exit; the outage class is API stops, now covered by rule +
honest codes). `docker events` forensics verified broken (~256-event ring ≈ minutes on
this box) — journalctl is the durable source. Contract + traps codified in AGENTS.md
("Production exit-code contract"). Rollout:
`docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-exit0-outage-audit.md`. Next prod stop/deploy should log
`app exited with code 143 after forwarded SIGTERM` as live confirmation.

**2026-08-02 — 5-Year Local Flat-File Price History Priority (ANTIGRAVITY).** Added `fetchLocalFlatFileHistory(symbol)` as the #1 primary tier in `src/lib/history.ts` (`fetchDailyOHLC`) and `fetchGroupedBarsLocal(date)` in `src/lib/market-signals/massive.ts`. Any pre-hoarded 5-year Massive flat files (`data/history-5y/`, `data/massive-history/`) are read directly from disk without hitting external REST APIs, providing instant zero-cost history for backtests and Congress.Trade EOD price feeds (`/api/market/prices/[symbol]`, `/api/market/spx`). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-local-flatfile-history-priority.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Mobile PWA owner-feedback round (Monet, cloud session).** Branch
`agent/antigravity/mobile-pwa-feedback` (applying patch from Monet): PWA gets
an Accounts section (switch broker account via `account.activate`, sign-out link to switch Google/Apple
login), per-proposal realtime approve/reject feedback (tapped button spins; card follows its queued
command through queued/running/succeeded/failed instead of failures hiding in the Command Log), and the
delete-account panel is collapsed behind a neutral link so it stops mimicking error banners. tsc clean,
mobile test file 10/10, lint 0 errors. Landed as #2351 (`44069368`).
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-mobile-pwa-owner-feedback.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Data-provider hardening, Round 1 (MONET, `monet/data-cascade-freshness`,
merged as #2353).** Implemented the free-tier research doc's own recommendations: Tiingo
now ALSO an OHLC-history source in `history.ts` (was enrichment-only — a configured key
delivered none of the promised adjusted-history value until this landed), dead Stooq tier
removed (confirmed PoW-bot-walled), keyless Treasury.gov yield-curve fallback (3M/2Y/10Y +
curves, no FRED key needed), Cboe VIX9D, SEC-XBRL `revenueGrowth`. Full gates green.
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-data-provider-hardening.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Data-provider hardening, Round 2/3 (MONET, `monet/data-cascade-providers-round2`).**
Closes out the rest of the same research doc: 3 new key-gated fundamentals/news providers
(Wisesheets, SimFin, Marketaux — all dormant until their env key is set), 2 new keyless
sources (BLS macro fallback wired into the Macro board, Nasdaq earnings-calendar backfill),
an S&P 500 constituents mirror (built, not yet wired to replace the static universe list —
see the rollout note), Yahoo 429 hardening, and Alpha Vantage/Finnhub earnings-calendar
fallbacks. USAspending.gov investigated and correctly NOT implemented (no free
recipient→ticker crosswalk exists). Full gates green: lint 0 errors, tsc clean, 5891/5891
tests, build clean. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-data-provider-round2.md`.

## Blockers

1. **RESOLVED 2026-08-02 — auto-deploy was broken by a webhook HMAC mismatch.** Every push
   to `refs/heads/main` was answered by Coolify with
   `[{"status":"failed","message":"Invalid signature."}]` (visible only in the GitHub hook
   delivery RESPONSE BODY — the hook page showed green 200s throughout), so no deployment
   was ever created; the queue sat empty and the single 2026-08-01 deploy was the owner's
   manual click. Repair: synced the GitHub hook secret to the Coolify app's
   `manual_webhook_secret_github`, deleted the exact-duplicate second hook, redelivered the
   newest main push -> a real deployment was created immediately, and
   `scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh 19dfd51b` reported **PASS** (~04:47Z). Merge==live is
   trustworthy again. Also fixed: AGENTS.md's stale Coolify uuid (the app is `socratic-app`
   now). Full receipts + recurrence warning:
   `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-deploy-webhook-secret-repair.md`.

2. **RESOLVED — npm `EALLOWSCRIPTS` on the shared git dep (and the earlier explanation
   here was wrong).** A clean-shell reproduction with the repo's exact files PASSES: the
   repo as committed installs fine, and a stale `allowScripts` tag was NOT the trigger.
   The real triggers (npm 11.16.0+, upstream bug npm/cli#9783, open, unfixed through npm
   12.0.2): an `allow-scripts=...` line in ANY `.npmrc` layer, or an inherited
   `npm_config_allow_scripts` env var — npm forwards it into its git-dep preparation
   subprocess, which rejects it as a flag. This Mac had live `npx`-launched processes
   exporting `npm_config_allow_scripts=@wasp.sh/wasp-cli`; any shell descending from that
   lineage fails every `npm ci` instantly. If EALLOWSCRIPTS appears: check
   `env | grep npm_config_allow_scripts` and relaunch the contaminated parent — and NEVER
   add `allow-scripts` to `.npmrc`, even though npm's own error message suggests it.
   Also fixed forward: `allowScripts` git-dep keys in tag form (`#vX.Y.Z`) can never match
   (npm compares against the resolved 40-char SHA), which npm 12 escalates from a warning
   to a hard block on the dep's `prepare` — the key is now committish-free
   (`"github:jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared": true`, verified: coverage warning
   gone). #2345's lockfile regen also fixed a real silent bug: the old lockfile pinned the
   v2.3.0 commit while package.json said v2.4.x, so `npm ci` was silently shipping the old
   shared package. Verified 2026-08-02: plain `npm ci` = exit 0, 575 packages, clean shell.
   (An earlier copy of this blocker blamed a stale `allowScripts` tag — corrected above;
   the union merge briefly duplicated both versions here, de-spliced 2026-08-02.)

3. **Two provider lanes are degraded and need an owner decision, not an agent fix.**
   FMP's plan probe returns 403 (subscription state) and Massive is history-capped to the
   free tier. Agents must not provision replacement keys. Several optional/telemetry lanes
   (Usage Monitor, VIX-Yahoo, Nasdaq Quote, some RapidAPI lanes) are also down; those are
   fallback tiers and the cascade still serves real data.

## Next action

- Watch that `c117afb9` (and subsequent merges) deploy organically via the repaired
  webhook — `bash scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh` after merging.
- (Retracted: the `schedulerLease.owner` "residual" flagged earlier does not exist — the
  landed code already strips the pid for unauthenticated callers; prod serves the bare
  instance uuid. Observation was made against the pre-deploy payload.)
- Owner decisions pending: FMP subscription, Massive plan tier; and whether hook-secret
  re-sync should be added to the Coolify app-recreate recipe (see the 2026-08-02 rollout
  note — if recreation regenerated the secret, this failure recurs on the next recreate).

## Conventions that bite (do not re-derive these)

- **Board files are `merge=union`.** `.gitattributes` union-merges `STATUS.md`,
  `PLAN.md`, and `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` so concurrent PRs do not conflict on them. The cost
  is that union **interleaves** both sides instead of conflicting, which silently produces
  duplicated rows and entries spliced under the wrong heading. `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` had 13
  exact-duplicate blocks from this (deduped 2026-08-01) and `STATUS.md` had one agent's
  notes filed under another's heading (preserved as evidence in `docs/status-archive.md`).
  Keep entries to a single line where you can, and re-read your own row after a merge.
- **Node 24 is required.** The Mac's default `node` is v26 and mass-fails the suite on a
  `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@24/bin:$PATH"`.

**2026-08-04 — Model slug migration tests and UI mapping fixes (Antigravity).**
Fixed `gpt-5.4-mini` regex inclusion in reasoning model capabilities which was causing test suite failures under Node 24. Also cleaned up `MODEL_DISPLAY_NAME` in `app/console/lib/models.ts` to strictly follow user-provided slugs, completely removing any legacy `-latest` suffixes. Verified tests locally.

**2026-08-04 — Revert accidental marketScan in from-draft preview (Antigravity).**
Fixed `test/chat-draft-policy.test.ts` test regression. A previous commit accidentally added a `fetchFreshQuotesCascade` call to the preview evaluation in `app/api/proposals/from-draft/route.ts`. Since the mock test broker returns real time quotes, this caused the "scan-less" preview to actually fetch a fresh quote and skip the expected `staleness_gate` block in tests. Reverted the addition so the preview returns to its scan-less state. All 10/10 tests pass, `land.sh` executed.
