# Status

Current snapshot for fast handoff across Codex, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, or a
human contributor. Update this when active focus, risks, or near-term next
steps materially change.

## Current State

- App: local-only Next.js agentic trading dashboard with honest
  **Test / Paper (Alpaca) / Brokerage** execution modes driven by the active
  connected account, policy gating, equity-only execution, and a phase-based
  design roadmap.
- Roadmap: `PLAN.md` tracks the cross-phase implementation order; `docs/`
  contains the per-phase design details.
- Latest documentation audit: 2026-06-18 reviewed all repo-authored Markdown
  outside dependency/generated directories, including ignored iCloud conflict
  copies. Canonical current docs were refreshed; ignored `" 2.md"` files are
  stale conflict snapshots and should not be used as source of truth.
- Latest completed design area in docs: `docs/phase-10-signals-learning-ui-v2.md`
  now reflects current shipped signals/learning/UI work and remaining gaps.
- GitHub: `main` and `phase-10` were pushed at `9bcf133` before the current
  follow-on Phase 10 work. Check `git status` before committing because Massive
  breadth/macro-sparkline work and RAG hardening may be in the local worktree.

## Active Focus

- 2026-06-21: **Short/cover broker-side translation (money-path).** Broker adapters forwarded our
  4-value `OrderSide` raw to buy/sell-only broker APIs, so a live `short`/`cover` was invalid (and the
  synthetic-stops engine emits `cover` outside the policy gate). New `src/lib/broker-side.ts`
  (`toBrokerSide`: short→sell, cover→buy); `alpaca.ts` translates on both order paths (Alpaca supports
  shorting, still gated by `shortSellingEnabled`); `robinhood.ts` `toMcpOrder` fails closed (throws on
  short/cover — no equity shorting). 423 tests (new `test/broker-side.test.ts`, incl. Alpaca SDK-mocked
  end-to-end), tsc + build clean. Built in isolated worktree off clean `main`; landing via PR. Rollout:
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-short-cover-broker-side-translation.md`.
- 2026-06-21: **Auth hardening — strip client identity headers on public routes.** The
  `middleware.ts` PUBLIC_PREFIXES branch (`/api/health`, `/api/webhooks`) forwarded requests unchanged,
  so a forged `x-authenticated-user-email`/`x-user-id` could pass to a public handler. New edge-safe
  `src/lib/auth/strip-identity.ts` (`stripClientIdentityHeaders`); both middleware branches now strip
  identity before forwarding (public stays unauthenticated — webhooks unaffected). Not exploitable
  today; closes the latent footgun. 459 tests (new `test/strip-identity.test.ts`), tsc + build clean.
  Isolated worktree off clean `main`; landing via PR. Rollout:
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-strip-identity-public-routes.md`.
- 2026-06-21: **Git author identity rule (GitHub email privacy).** Codified in `AGENTS.md`: all
  commits/pushes use the owner's GitHub noreply email
  (`12656028+jaywedgeworth22@users.noreply.github.com`), never the real email. Repo-local
  `user.email` already set repo-wide (all worktrees inherit via shared `.git/config`; global stays
  the real email for other repos). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-git-email-identity-rule.md`.
- 2026-06-21 (`agent/claude`): **Deferred-task sweep — P0 safety re-application + IC backtest +
  buying-power gate.** Worked the financial-expert-panel backlog in the ISOLATED
  `~/apps/trading-claude` worktree (the prior P0 work was wiped twice from the co-edited main
  integration worktree by concurrent PR merges; moved here per the multi-agent rule and committed
  each chunk). Landed: (1) `bddaa35` the full P0 safety slice — size-less-exit reject + full-position
  resolve, fail-closed Red Team (`available` flag + 45s timeout → human review), atomic
  crash-recoverable order placement (`placing` intent row + `ref_id` persistence + run-start stale
  sweep) on both autonomous + approval paths, account-level drawdown/daily-loss kill-switch
  (`src/lib/risk-breaker.ts`), real `/api/health` probe + scheduler heartbeat, SSE per-tenant
  filter (+12 tests); (2) `4ea77a8` an IC backtest harness (`src/lib/backtest.ts` — Spearman factor
  ICs over `signal_snapshot` audits → advisory IC-derived weights, dev-gated
  `GET /api/admin/backtest-ic`, +10 tests); (3) `71698a5` a buying-power affordability gate (+4
  tests). tsc clean, **441 tests**. Restored the wiped panel review doc
  (`docs/reviews/2026-06-21-financial-expert-panel.md`). **Hand off:** merge `agent/claude` → `main`
  deliberately. Remaining (staged in the rollout note): cost model, PDT gate, clientOrderId
  broker-truth sweep, native brackets, factor orthogonalization, real macro feed, P3 polish. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-deferred-tasks-p0-backtest.md`.
- 2026-06-21: **Logo source toggle + logo.dev integration.** Added logo.dev as a cascade fallback behind GitHub in the `/api/logos/ticker` proxy. Client detects dark/light mode via MutationObserver and passes `&theme=`. Added `LOGO_DEV_TOKEN` env var support. Added a "Logo source" Segmented control in Settings → Display so the user can compare GitHub vs logo.dev logos live. Preference stored in localStorage, propagated to all TickerLogo instances via custom event. API route accepts `?source=auto|github|logodev` and reorders the cascade. LOGO_DEV_TOKEN added to `.env.local` and documented in `.env.example`. Rollout note: `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-logo-dev-toggle.md`.
- 2026-06-21: **Accounts connection modal and list formatting simplification.** Simplified Alpaca connection buttons to a single "Connect Alpaca Account" and derived Paper vs Brokerage environment dynamically based on `PA` account number prefix. Enforced required account numbers for Alpaca. Reformatted connected accounts listing with custom titles, green `CONNECTED` and red `AUTONOMOUS` status indicators, and localized test account formatting.
- 2026-06-21: **Alpaca MCP connection & multi-account connection buttons.** Added Alpaca MCP paper/live support, implemented standard JSON-RPC SSE tool call routing with REST client fallback, fixed order type mapping build issues, and ensured all connection buttons remain visible in the dashboard UI for multi-account linking. Verified: tsc clean, 401 tests green, build OK. Rollout note: `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-alpaca-mcp-integration.md`.
- 2026-06-21 (`agent/claude`): **Multi-agent coordination — verified + gap-filled; landing via PR.** The
  landing protocol that stops the `main` push-races + Q0 worktree collision was already implemented on
  `main` (pre-push hook, `scripts/land.sh`, `core.hooksPath` wiring, AGENTS.md protocol). A 4-agent design
  workflow independently reproduced + validated it and surfaced the honest limits. Added a `land.sh`
  self-heal preflight (auto-sets `core.hooksPath` so a non-bootstrapped worktree still gets the main-push
  guard — closes red-team gap #3), **resolved Q0** (option a), and documented the review +
  residual-limits in `docs/reviews/2026-06-21-multi-agent-coordination-review.md`. Limits that need Jay:
  no server branch protection (private repo → consider GitHub Pro/Team + merge queue); `--no-verify`
  bypass; hooks guard pushes not file-writes; CI inert until `gh auth refresh -s workflow`. **This change
  is landing via `scripts/land.sh` (PR), not a direct push** — dog-fooding the protocol. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-coordination-verify-and-gapfill.md`.
- 2026-06-21 (`agent/claude`): **Chat NOW tranche shipped + I4 (real citations).** Executed the approved
  NOW tranche on `main` (`7d766de`→`7a675e8`): I1 stop quote fabrication, I2 server-side disclaimer guard
  + `PROMPT_VERSION 0.4.0`, I3 multi-turn transcript replay, I6 read-only state tools
  (positions/portfolio/watchlist/alerts/proposals — one-way, no execution), I13 router-matched
  suggested-prompt chips (8-K framing). Then on `agent/claude`: **I4** — `retrieveContextDetailed`
  returns REAL provenance (vector id, score, the chunk's own acceptance date, filing url) so citations
  stop fabricating `<SYMBOL>#i` / the query's as_of; the UI renders citation chips as filing links.
  Verified: tsc clean, **412 tests**. Running questions log: `docs/open-questions-for-jay.md` (Q0 =
  worktree collision — a concurrent agent is mid-edit on `main`'s `strategy.ts`/`db.ts`/etc., so this
  lane moved to the isolated `~/apps/trading-claude` worktree and lands via PR). See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-chat-now-tranche-and-i4.md`.
- 2026-06-21 (`agent/claude`): **Best-of-each branch reconciliation landed on `main`.** A 7-agent
  comparison (`docs/reviews/2026-06-21-branch-reconciliation-best-of-each.md`) resolved the parallel
  agent lanes; the recommended picks were cherry-picked + verified: **tuner missed-opportunity
  counterfactuals** (`6fa51b5`), **SQLite/LLM safety hardening** (`877bb45`, incl. a `\n` prompt bug),
  **AccountCapabilities + two-layer short gate + CI workflow activation** (`d014842`), **logo.dev
  cascade fallback** (`e5dd681`, complementary to main's tile-contrast fix), and **lucide-react 1.21**.
  The antigravity responsive header was already correctly merged to `main` (no regressions — `lg:`
  shell / `min-h-16` / aria-labels / Score-col-2 all intact). **Held:** @types/node 26 (tsc break),
  eslint 10 (peer conflict), zod 4 + next 16 (need migrations). Verified: tsc clean, **404 tests**,
  build green. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-best-of-each-integration.md`.
- 2026-06-21: **Chat/RAG/learning advisory — HYBRID decision + issue log + roadmap.** A 5-agent expert
  panel (RAG, NL-finance-chat, onboarding, prompt/tools, LLM-learning) reviewed the chat assistant and
  unanimously landed on **HYBRID**: ISOLATE write surfaces (execution, strategy weight/risk tuning,
  conversation memory) but SHARE the read substrate (RAG corpus, user constraints, and NEW read-only
  views of positions/P&L/proposals/watchlist/scorecards) — one-way (outcomes flow into chat; chat
  opinions never steer the trading brain except a confirm-gated constraints→policy path). Logged 13
  tracked issues incl. **3 ship-blockers in the shipped chat** (quotes fabricate `change_pct:0`;
  refusal+disclaimer live only in MockLLM so they vanish on the real-LLM path; single-turn —
  `chat_turns` never replayed), the user-guidance design, and a NOW/NEXT/LATER roadmap. User decisions:
  multi-LLM choice (key provisioning deferred), **NOW tranche approved**, constraint→policy via explicit
  confirm + lean integrated learning. Docs only — no code. See `docs/chat-assistant-rag-learning.md` +
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-chat-rag-learning-advisory.md`.
- 2026-06-21: **Responsive header command buttons.** Restructured header buttons to shrink gracefully on narrow screens and wrap cleanly into exactly 2 lines below the `md` (768px) breakpoint.
- 2026-06-21: **UI/UX + iPad/iPhone audit and quick-win implementation.** Ran two
  multi-agent audits (real-Chrome desktop walkthrough → 64-agent review/verify/synthesis; source-grounded
  iPad/iPhone → 27-agent) and shipped the quick wins + high-severity fixes: Market Scan **Score → column 2**
  + horizontal scroll; **zero P&L/tax values now neutral** (`pnlTone`); **light-mode ticker logos fixed**
  (dark tile); **reduced-motion guard** + **iOS 16px inputs**; **macro sparkline polarity** + "Broad USD"
  relabel; Settings tab overflow + no-jump min-height; drilldown header truncation/dedup; a11y (select
  labels, tabpanel ARIA, ≥44px touch targets); chart vertical-touch-scroll; **iPad cockpit shell `xl`→`lg`**;
  and **setup-state run failures render amber** instead of red. Verified: tsc clean, **386 tests**, build
  green; live-confirmed on :4100. Full reports:
  `docs/reviews/2026-06-20-ui-ux-and-mobile-audit.md`; **itemized status-tagged backlog of every
  issue:** `docs/reviews/2026-06-21-ui-ux-issue-register.md`; rollout:
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-ui-ux-audit-and-quick-wins.md`. **Deferred:** F1 backend root cause
  (`src/lib/strategy.ts` `policy.accountNumber` wiring — UI softened only); deleting the **dead
  `app/ui/dashboard/{views,components,utils,settings}.tsx`** parallel implementation; header overflow menu;
  full safe-area/`viewport-fit=cover`. Merged to `main` (2026-06-21).
- 2026-06-21 (`claude/minor-cleanups-data-providers`): **Minor cleanup, zero behavior change.**
  Removed the unused `export const fallbackProvider` alias in `src/lib/data-providers.ts` (confirmed
  referenced nowhere else; `noopProvider` kept — used by tests). Added clarifying one-line comments in
  `src/lib/db.ts` `dailyExecutionStats` / `notionalInLastMinutes` explaining notional caps intentionally
  count only OPENING trades (buy/short); closing trades (sell/cover) are risk-reducing and exempt
  (notional = 0) — comments only, no logic change. tsc clean, 371 tests pass, build OK. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-data-providers-cleanup.md`.
- 2026-06-21 (`claude/proposal-timestamps-ui-t7qab1`): **Proposal staleness —
  UI + expiry policy + on-run LLM re-validation.** (Part 1, UI) Pending-approval
  cards show `Proposed <date, time> · <relative age>` with an escalating staleness
  state; removed the redundant "Test Mode" brand-block line + dead
  `executionTone()`; fixed the "too thin"/clipped command bar (`xl:h-14`/`xl:py-0`
  → `min-h-16`). (Part 2, backend) New `src/lib/proposal-revalidation.ts`:
  **deterministic hard expiry** (`policy.proposalExpiryMinutes`, default 2880 =
  2 days; runs at run-start AND every scheduler tick → status `expired`) and a
  **cadence-gated on-run LLM re-check** (`proposalRevalidateCadenceHours`, default
  0 = every run; not optional) that, inside `runStrategyOnce`, asks the LLM whether
  each *due* still-pending proposal still stands — **regular market hours only** (no
  overnight checks). Dropdown: Every run / Once per day / Every 5 days.
  `reaffirm` stamps `last_revalidated_at` (UI: "Re-checked X ago — still
  advised"), `withdraw` → status `withdrawn` + `proposal_withdrawn` notification.
  Safe-by-default: ambiguous LLM output keeps the proposal; market closed / no
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` ⇒ LLM pass skips but deterministic expiry still runs. Both
  surfaced as **dropdowns** + a notification toggle in Settings → Risk. The
  **Flow** button was a question (static React Flow pipeline visualizer,
  `app/ui/strategy-flow.tsx`) — left in place. tsc clean, **314 tests** (+7),
  build green. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-proposal-timestamps-and-header-cleanup.md`.
- 2026-06-21 (`chore/safety-quick-wins`): **Failure-mode review + first safety quick-wins.**
  A 12-agent failure-mode brainstorm (114 findings → ~70 distinct) plus a 5-agent
  adversarial verification of the Top 5 (4 confirmed, 1 — "synthetic stops are an
  ungated real-trade cannon" — substantially overstated, crit→low). Full writeup:
  `docs/reviews/2026-06-20-failure-mode-brainstorm.md`. Landed the first quick-win
  batch (no behavior change to the money path): SQLite `busy_timeout=5000` +
  `synchronous=NORMAL` PRAGMAs, bull/bear `JSON.parse` guards (degrade instead of
  crashing the run), `bearSystemPrompt` `\n` join fix, `confidenceScore` clamp +
  schema bounds, and **CI activation** (`ci-pending/*.yml` → `.github/workflows/`).
  tsc clean, 390 tests, build green. NOTE: pushing the CI workflows needs the
  GitHub token re-scoped (`gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow`). Deep fixes
  still open: auth layer (T1), execution-section CAS/atomicity (T4/T5), portfolio
  circuit breaker (#7), boot-time autonomy interlock (T3). See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-safety-quick-wins.md`.
- 2026-06-21: **AccountCapabilities classifier.** Added `AccountCapabilities` interface
  covering equity, shortSelling, options (CBOE level 0–4), futures, crypto, margin, and
  accountType (brokerage/IRA/crypto_exchange). Wired into Robinhood and Alpaca gateways,
  DB persistence (JSON column + migration), policy two-layer short gate, strategy context,
  and coloured capability badges on account cards. Robinhood MCP confirmed: shortSelling
  always false. tsc clean · 390 tests · build OK. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-account-capabilities.md`.
- 2026-06-21: **Alpaca custom base URL & test encryption environment fix.** Added support for custom API base URL for connected Alpaca accounts, and cleaned early-import environment loading inside `src/lib/db.ts` to bypass test environments. Upserted active Alpaca paper trading credentials successfully.
- 2026-06-20: **Alpaca Custom Base URL, DB Encryption Fix & Fintech Studios Integration.** Added custom API endpoint/base URL override in Alpaca account UI, sanitizing trailing `/v2` automatically. Fixed Next.js early-boot race condition by dynamically loading `.env.local` inside `src/lib/db.ts` to ensure stable credentials encryption across server restarts. Integrated Fintech Studios sentiment/news provider in the enrichment cascade. tsc clean, 390 tests, build OK. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-alpaca-custom-base-url-and-db-fix.md`.
- 2026-06-20: **Money-path safety plan (T1–T14) merged to main.** All 14 tasks complete:
  side-aware notional/exposure caps (T1/T10), partial-fill reconciliation (T2), FIFO lot matcher (T3),
  paper-projection guards (T5), db notional tests (T6), short exits (T8), recordFill tests (T9),
  red-team fail-open (T11), tax long-only pin (T12), explicit daily-reset timezone (T13),
  `account_number → __unassigned__` sentinel (T14-db). 386 tests, tsc clean, build clean.
  See rollout `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-money-path-merge-gate.md`.
- **Completed follow-ups:** gross/net exposure caps added to Settings UI (NumberField + RangeField
  sliders; 0 = no cap); `OpenLot.quantity` now signed (negative for shorts, matches `EquityPosition`).
- 2026-06-20: **AI order-drafting "Assistant" tab (chat → confirm → place).** A 5-agent design panel
  chose a hybrid surface; built per the user's picks (full Assistant tab; live/brokerage allowed with a
  red real-order confirm; inline confirm). New `app/ui/assistant-console.tsx` + an `assistant`
  WorkspaceTab: a chat draft from `/api/chat` is bridged via a new `POST /api/proposals/from-draft`
  (dry-run preview, or insert a `proposed` row — idempotent on `runId='chat:'+draftId`) into the
  UNCHANGED approve → `executeProposal` rail, so the chat module gains **no** execution capability. The
  destination pill derives from the live `executionState`; the mapper (`src/lib/chat/promote-draft.ts`)
  sets the required `TradeProposal` fields and rejects non-buy/sell. tsc clean, 371 tests, build OK,
  verified live (a halted system correctly blocks at the dry-run before any row is minted). See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-ai-order-drafting-assistant-tab.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/claude`): **Codex lane reconciled + money-path T5 (paper-projection guards).**
  Codex is usage-capped for days, so Claude took over its lane: a 3-agent parity audit had already
  confirmed Codex's only unmerged commit (tax-treatment + hourly-cap WIP) is fully superseded by
  `main` (R1/R3) with an explicit DO-NOT-MERGE, so there was no unique code to land — reconciled
  `agent/codex` to current `main` (merge favoring main, src now byte-identical), reset its stale local
  `data/app.db` (old `taxation_type NOT NULL` schema), and verified 4101 serving 200. Then advanced the
  money path: fixed **T5** — `getPaperPortfolioProjection` side-blindness (wrong-sign/flat closes +
  opposite-side cost averaging), pinned with 6 tests. tsc clean, 365 tests. `agent/codex`, `agent/claude`,
  `main` pushed. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-money-path-t5-paper-projection.md` +
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-codex-tax-notional-wip-superseded.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/claude` → `main`): **Landed Claude lane to `main`; last `node:crypto` holdout reconciled.**
  Merged `main` into `agent/claude` to catch up on the 6 Atlas ports + the committed `node:crypto`
  instrumentation fix (`03c6f27`), then merged `agent/claude` → `main` (no-ff) to land the money-path
  tranche-1 fixes below. Fixed the one holdout `03c6f27` missed — `src/lib/memory/store.ts` now imports
  bare `crypto`, not `node:crypto` (mandatory: the `node:` scheme breaks the Next.js instrumentation
  webpack build with `UnhandledSchemeError`). 4100 (PM2 `trading-claude`) verified serving 200; `main` +
  `agent/claude` pushed to origin. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-claude-lane-integration-and-node-crypto-reconcile.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/claude`): **Money-path safety — tranche 1 (4 bug fixes + 20 tests).**
  From an adversarially-verified audit (38 findings → 12 confirmed → 14-task plan): fixed the
  side-blind per-symbol notional cap that could block automated de-risking exits (T1,
  `policy.ts`), dropped Alpaca partial fills (T2, `strategy.ts` `reconcilePendingFills`,
  idempotent), the side-blind FIFO matcher that erased opposite-side lots at $0 P&L (T3,
  `performance.ts`), and shorts getting no / wrong-side protective exits (T8, `strategy.ts` +
  `synthetic-stops.ts`). Pinned with 20 regression tests (short/cover P&L signs, side-aware
  caps, enabled-path short guardrails, partial-fill booking, synthetic-stop cover exit). tsc
  clean, 327 tests, build green. Remaining: T5/T6/T9–T14 (coverage + cleanup; T10 = gross/net
  exposure-gate design decision). Landed to `main` 2026-06-20 via integration merge (see entry above).
  See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-money-path-safety-fixes.md`.
- 2026-06-20: **Atlas public repo retired + 6 subsystems ported to TS.** Reviewed `jaywedgeworth22/public`
  (the "Atlas" BFF) via a 14-agent inventory, preserved it whole (git bundle of all 9 branches + source →
  `reference/atlas-public-src/`), retired its live deployment (uninstalled the `com.jays.trading` BFF + the
  `com.jays.trading.autoupdate` 5-min git-puller + backup cron — reversible bits in `~/.atlas-retired/`),
  and **emptied** the public repo to a tombstone. Ported the genuinely-useful, not-yet-present work to
  TypeScript with tests: RAG structure-aware chunking + `as_of` point-in-time; multi-channel alert delivery
  (push/webhook/email/SMS); conversation transcript + redact-on-write; salience-gated memory; and a chat
  orchestrator (LLM tool-loop, draft-only — never executes) + a 10-case no-execute eval gate. New tables
  `notification_prefs`/`chat_turns`/`user_memory`; new APIs `/api/chat`, `/api/memory`, `/api/notifications`,
  `/api/chat-history`. Deleted the redundant `~/agentic-trading` clone. Verified: tsc clean, 339 tests, build OK.
  **Open:** user to confirm the tunnel still serves the dashboard (then `rm -rf ~/Code/trading`); UI wiring for
  the chat/memory/notify surfaces is deferred (backends only). See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-atlas-public-retire-and-port.md`.
- 2026-06-20: **Branch hygiene + Cursor Cloud docs integrated.** Cherry-picked the Cursor
  Cloud setup docs onto `main` (`55213d2`) and pruned branches → the tree is now `main` plus
  the three agent worktree branches. Deleted (tip SHAs in the rollout note for recovery):
  `agent/antigravity-local` (`095175c`, superseded), `codex/phase-7-…` (`b990c14`, merged),
  `codex/upload-current-state` (`47786c4`, merged), and remote
  `cursor/setup-dev-environment-a574` (`7e82278`, integrated). See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-branch-hygiene-and-a574-integration.md`.
- 2026-06-20: **Cursor positioned as the human review cockpit (not a 4th agent).** Documented
  Cursor's role in `AGENTS.md` (Hosting & dev servers section: integration row now credits Cursor +
  a new "Cursor: the human review cockpit" subsection) and added `.cursor/rules/handoff.mdc`
  (always-applied) so Cursor follows the same read-order + pre-commit handoff protocol as
  Claude/Codex/Antigravity. Cursor occupies the `main` integration seat (`~/Code/Agentic Trading`)
  for review/merge/hand-edits; agent/background runs stay on `cursor/*` branches
  (`origin/cursor/setup-dev-environment-*` already exist). Docs/config only — no code or tests
  changed; landed in `c80a96d` (a concurrent integration commit bundled it with the worktree
  relocation + the `robinhood-agentic-dashboard`→`agentic-trading-dashboard` rename). `main` is
  ahead of `origin/main` pending a push. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-cursor-integration-role-and-rules.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`cursor/setup-dev-environment`): **Cursor Cloud dev environment
  setup.** Installed deps and verified the run/test/build flow in the Cloud VM
  (`npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm test` 283 tests, `npm run build` green, `npm
  run dev` on :3000 with a watchlist-config hello-world in Test mode). Added a
  `## Cursor Cloud specific instructions` section to `AGENTS.md` clarifying that
  the host worktree/PM2/port-4100 setup does not apply to the single
  `/workspace` Cloud checkout. No source code changed. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-cursor-cloud-env-setup.md`.
- 2026-06-21: **vector-db userId sanitization + timestamp parsing hardening.**
  `getClients()` now sanitizes `userId` before resolving Pinecone/Voyage keys so
  key-lookup identity matches the Pinecone filter identity (multi-tenant
  isolation fix); `[Published: YYYY-MM-DD]` prefixing now handles string/number
  (epoch ms)/Date timestamps; `retryAfterMs` exported for testing. tsc clean;
  `npm test`/`npm run build` NOT run in Cowork sandbox (host node_modules are
  macOS-only) — run locally. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-21-vector-db-userid-timestamp-hardening.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/antigravity`): **Rename project to Agentic Trading in documents.** Renamed the project title in `PLAN.md` to "Agentic Trading Dashboard", ensuring the overall application is consistently referred to as "Agentic Trading" rather than "Robinhood Agentic Trading" (now broker-neutral to support Alpaca and multi-broker setups). Verifications passed: tsc clean, 287 tests green, build OK.
- 2026-06-20 (integration): **Public-repo consolidation into private dashboard.** Imported Atlas
  (`jaywedgeworth22/public`) design docs to `docs/atlas/`, archived reference material under
  `reference/atlas-public/`, and ported **user watchlist** + **price alerts** (SQLite + API routes +
  scheduler poller + `price_alert` notifications). Chat orchestrator, conversation history, and
  salience memory remain deferred — see `docs/atlas-integration-map.md` and
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-public-repo-consolidation.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/claude`): **Blueprint R1–R5 completion (in progress).** 6-agent audit of the
  Antigravity/Codex blueprint work, with findings verified against real code (several audit "bugs" were
  false positives reading the blueprint's example snippets; R4 multi-tenant RAG was already shipped by
  `worker_m4_1`). Shipped so far: **R1 tri-state safety banner** (deployed `5747770`); **R3 IRA taxation**
  (IRA ⇒ 0% tax + own-account wash-sale bypass; a TAXABLE-account loss locks rebuys across ALL accounts
  incl. IRAs via `getUserWashSaleLockedSymbols`); **R1 hourly notional cap + auto-revert** to `propose` on
  breach; schema/types foundation (`taxation_type` column, `maxHourlyNotional`, `synthetic_trailing_stops`
  table + accessors, `notionalInLastMinutes`); UI for the hourly cap + a tax-treatment picker. 278 tests,
  build green. **Now also shipped:** the Run/Resume/autonomy controls consolidated into one **Start/Stop**
  + **approval-mode** selector (Propose/Decide) + **Run once**; **R2 synthetic trailing-stop monitor**
  (`synthetic-stops.ts`, +5 tests) with **H4 gated market exits** (scheduler fires them only for
  Started/active users — `systemState==="halted"` ⇒ no orders). **Deferred:** H3 native Alpaca trailing
  (needs a broad `OrderType` change — the synthetic path covers Alpaca for now). 283 tests, build green.
  See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-r1-r5-audit-and-safety-banner.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/claude`): **Broker honesty + account-drives-mode — shipped to `trading.jays.services` (`03bfc38`).**
  Robinhood now connects via its MCP (root cause of the long OAuth failure: the redirect URI must be a
  `http://localhost` loopback, NOT the public Cloudflare-fronted `.services` URL — see memory
  `robinhood-mcp-oauth-prod`). Removed the fabricated `MockRobinhoodGateway` → honest `TestBrokerGateway`
  (real quotes + simulated fills); Robinhood is MCP-only; renamed all `Mock/Local`→`Test`,
  `mock/local`→`test/local`, `Broker Paper`/`Broker Live`→`Paper`/`Brokerage` across src/app/tests
  (the internal `broker/paper`·`broker/live` mode strings stay). The **active connected account drives
  the mode** (Test = local sim / Alpaca Paper / Brokerage); `paperMode` is derived in `getPolicy`; the
  Switch-to-Test/Brokerage toggle is retired; a seeded **Test** account is the always-available safe
  default; Alpaca paper-vs-brokerage derives from the API key prefix (PK/AK); the connect route syncs only
  the Robinhood agentic account. Reconciled with Codex `8654289` (execution-rag) and `e390851` (triggers).
  tsc clean, 261 tests, build green; prod kept on Test, autonomy halted. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-broker-honesty-redesign.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/codex`): **Broker-neutral account connection wording.**
  Updated Accounts UI copy so users are told to connect one or more supported
  accounts when they want broker-backed execution, with Paper accounts optional
  and user-selected. The account modal keeps explicit buttons for Robinhood MCP,
  Alpaca Paper, and Alpaca Brokerage, and Robinhood edit states now describe the
  MCP/OAuth sync path instead of exposing Paper/API-key wording. Docs were
  aligned in README, PLAN, Phase 11, and the architecture blueprint. Verification
  passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (37 files, 261 tests), `npm run build`,
  `git diff --check`, Playwright smoke against temporary `next start`, PM2
  `trading-codex` restart, `/api/health`, and a focused Accounts modal browser
  smoke on port 4101. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-broker-neutral-account-connection-copy.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (worker_m4_1): **Multi-Tenant RAG & Rate-Limit Hardening.** Implemented User ID sanitization, Voyage API rate limit Full Jitter backoff, publication date prepending, parallel Pinecone queries for custom tenants with in-memory deduplication/ranking, Finnhub/FMP transient cache poisoning prevention, Alpha Vantage HTTP 200 warning detection, and raw-user credential lookup preservation. Verification passed: tsc clean, 271 tests green, build OK. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-multi-tenant-rag-rate-limit-hardening.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/claude`): **Event-trigger Phase 1 (deterministic, no LLM).** Grounded in a
  4-agent investigation of the post-Codex fill/regime/broker surface. (1) **Regime flip detector**
  (`src/lib/regime-watch.ts`) on the scheduler tick — persists `regime:current`, audits + pushes +
  broadcasts a (non-triggering) material event on a flip. (2) **Real-time fills** — Alpaca
  `trade_updates` WebSocket worker (binary frames → JSON, no msgpack) → `onBrokerFill`
  (`src/lib/fills.ts`) reconciles + emits a dashboard `order` event; **fills never trigger an LLM
  run** (expert policy). Opt-in `STREAMS_ALPACA_TRADE_UPDATES_ENABLED`. (3) Closed an SSE gap (run-loop
  placement now emits `order`). Note: true bracket/OCO orders don't exist here — "re-arm brackets" is
  reconcile + a deferred risk re-check. tsc clean, 261 tests, build green; live `trade_updates`
  authorized + regime seeded. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-phase1-deterministic-triggers.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/codex`): **Terminology documentation alignment.**
  Fast-forwarded the Codex worktree to the integrated `main` tip and aligned
  current-state docs with the runtime Test/Paper/Brokerage terminology. No code
  behavior changed. Verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (37
  files, 261 tests), `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, PM2 `trading-codex`
  restart, and `/api/health` on port 4101. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-terminology-doc-alignment.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/codex`): **Execution/RAG/LLM Blueprint Foundations.**
  Implemented the first runtime slice from `docs/architecture-blueprint.md`:
  `deriveExecutionState(...)` now distinguishes `test/local`, `broker/paper`,
  and `broker/live`; active Alpaca Paper accounts no longer force local
  `paperMode`; strategy, tuning, red-team, and post-mortem LLM context uses the
  same terms; dashboard safety labels show Test, Paper, or Brokerage; OpenAI
  requests share deterministic temperature + output caps; and
  Pinecone RAG guards reserved metadata, queries user-or-public context, and uses
  exponential jittered retry delays. Verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`,
  `npm test` (37 files, 261 tests), `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, PM2
  `trading-codex` restart, health/root HTTP checks, and in-app browser Settings
  -> Operate visual smoke. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-execution-rag-llm-foundations.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/antigravity`): **Alpaca Single-Key & OAuth Authentication Support.** Fully enabled Alpaca connection and streaming utilizing only an API Key (OAuth token) without requiring a separate Secret Key. Swapped headers to `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for REST news enrichment fetches when secret key is empty, and updated WebSocket news and trade updates streams to authenticate with `{ action: "auth", key: "oauth", secret: token }`. Adjusted settings modal input placeholders to clarify optional status of the API Secret field. Verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (261 tests), and `npm run build`. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-20-alpaca-oauth-single-key.md`.
- 2026-06-20 (`agent/antigravity`): **Architecture Blueprint Alignment.** Drafted `docs/architecture-blueprint.md` as a target architecture, not completed runtime implementation, covering:
  1. Section 1.4: Autonomous Live Execution Security Gate & keyframe/animation definitions for animate-pulse-fast.
  2. Section 2.5: Synthetic Stop Edge Case Mitigations.
  3. Sections 3.3 & 3.4: Taxation Policy Settings (IRA Support) - Wash Sale Prevention & DB/Types mapping.
  4. Section 4.4: Multi-Tenant RAG & Rate Limit Hardening.
  5. Sections 5.5 & 5.6: Prompt Caching Surcharge/Eviction & Prompt Abbreviations Glossary.
  The blueprint was corrected after review to avoid implying unfinished controls are already live. Verification passed: TypeScript compiler checks, unit tests, and Next.js production build.
- 2026-06-19 (`agent/antigravity`): **Branch consolidation and plan review.** Committed all uncommitted Codex workspace changes, merged `agent/codex` into `main`, and integrated the updated `main` branch into `agent/claude` and `agent/antigravity` worktrees. Verified the unified tree with type checking, unit tests, and Next.js builds. Reviewed all consolidated plans, UX expert guidance, and cross-functional expert guidelines. Devised a review report and architectural flow. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-branch-consolidation-and-review.md`.
- 2026-06-19 (`agent/codex`): **Expert guidance consolidation.** Consolidated
  scattered UI/design/financial-products UX advice into
  `docs/reviews/ui-expert-guidance.md`, and non-UI strategy/architecture/LLM/risk/data
  expert-panel advice into `docs/reviews/cross-functional-expert-guidance.md`.
  Original dated reviews and rollout notes remain as evidence; the new docs are
  the entry points for future work. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-expert-guidance-consolidation.md`.
- 2026-06-19 (`agent/codex`): **Ticker logo display preference.** Added a
  cached `/api/logos/ticker` proxy for `davidepalazzo/ticker-logos` PNGs and a
  local Settings → Display preference for Normal tile, Transparent, or Off.
  Portfolio symbols, Market Scan rows, and Symbol Intelligence headers now use
  the selected display mode while falling back to text when a logo is missing.
  Verification passed: raw GitHub PNG HEAD probe, focused logo tests, `npx tsc
  --noEmit`, `npm test` (248 tests), `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, PM2
  preview restart, local `/api/health`, `/api/logos/ticker?symbol=AAPL`, root
  `localhost:4101/`, and Playwright Settings → Display + mobile overflow smoke.
  See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-ticker-logo-display.md`.
- 2026-06-19 (`agent/codex`): **Operate universe UI and backend index support.**
  Settings → Operate now groups Base indexes, Additional Watchlist, and Ignore
  List together; S&P 500 is the default starting universe, and base indexes are
  large multi-select toggle buttons for S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow 30. A
  one-time backend migration moves untouched empty default policies to S&P 500
  without reapplying after a user intentionally clears the universe. Backend
  policy expansion, policy API validation, scanner counts, and LLM tuning
  context now use the same shared index-universe source, with the Ignore List
  subtracting from both indexes and additional symbols. Smart Money tickers fall
  back to sparse symbol-drawer records instead of inert bold text when the latest
  scan lacks that symbol. Verification passed: focused default-universe
  migration test, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (250 tests), `npm run build`,
  `git diff --check`, PM2 preview restart, `/api/health`, `/api/policy`,
  `HEAD /`, and identity-encoded `GET /` returning 200 on port 4101. Browser
  visual verification was attempted through the in-app browser but blocked by
  Browser Use URL policy. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-operate-universe-watchlist-ignore.md`.
- 2026-06-19 (`agent/codex`): **Worktree cleanup.** Normalized the partial
  staged/unstaged index left after the Claude pickup and Codex patch reapply,
  kept the documented UI audit, pending-demand, and Market Scan VWAP changes,
  and verified the combined state with `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (242
  tests), `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, PM2 preview restart, and
  `/api/health` + `/api/scan` returning 200 on port 4101. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-codex-worktree-cleanup.md`.
- 2026-06-19 (`agent/codex`): **Shared market-data pending demand.** Added
  durable `market_data_demands` for failed public OHLC reads, source-scoped
  history cache writes, and a `market-data` SSE event so a later shared cache
  fill refreshes prior requesters without spending another user's private key.
  User-key provider fills remain private by default unless
  `MARKET_DATA_SHARE_USER_KEYED_HISTORY=on`; the pending TTL is controlled by
  `MARKET_DATA_PENDING_TTL_MS`. Full verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`,
  `npm test` (242 tests), `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, PM2 preview
  restart, and `/api/health` on port 4101. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-market-data-pending-demand.md`.
- 2026-06-19 (`agent/codex`): **Claude pickup + scan-row VWAP follow-up.**
  Fast-forwarded the Codex worktree to Claude's streaming/event-trigger tip,
  preserved the existing Codex UI audit patch, and continued Claude's explicit
  VWAP follow-up by surfacing `price vs VWAP` in Market Scan rows. `/api/scan`
  now opportunistically merges cached Massive grouped daily `vw` data into
  `MarketQuote.vwap`/`MarketQuoteSummary.vwap` with source attribution
  (`massive-vwap`); the table shows a sortable `vs VWAP` column and degrades to
  `-` when no Massive key/data is available. Verification passed: `npx tsc
  --noEmit`, `npm test` (240 tests), `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and
  Codex preview `/api/health` + `/api/scan` returned 200. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-claude-pickup-vwap-scan.md`.
- 2026-06-19 (`agent/claude`): **Streaming + event-trigger pass.** (1) **VWAP surfaced** —
  dashed overlay + "% vs VWAP" on the price chart. (2) **order/proposal SSE emits**
  (`executeProposal`/`rejectProposal`/cancel route). (3) **Alpaca news WebSocket worker** —
  first outbound stream (`src/lib/streams/`), opt-in `STREAMS_ALPACA_NEWS_ENABLED`, push-feeds a
  news store the enrichment provider reads first (REST fallback); live-verified `authenticated +
  subscribed`. (4) **Event-driven LLM trigger engine** (`src/lib/triggers.ts`, Phase 0/2, DEFAULT
  OFF) — mode switch, debounce/coalesce, `admitRun` gate (cooldowns + hourly/daily caps), dedup,
  8-K material-item producer; policy from a 4-expert panel (see
  `docs/event-driven-llm-triggering.md`). tsc clean, 239 tests, build green. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-vwap-emits-ws-worker-trigger-engine.md`.
- 2026-06-19 (`agent/claude`): **Push-vs-poll + compute-offload pass.** Added
  `docs/data-architecture-push-vs-poll.md` (durable principles + opportunity inventory +
  scoping). Shipped: (1) **VWAP capture** — we were dropping Massive's `vw`; now in
  `GroupedDailyBar`/`OHLCBar.vwap`. (2) **Sentiment offload** — cascade prefers Alpha Vantage's
  real `NEWS_SENTIMENT` over the `scoreHeadlines` keyword proxy. (3) **SSE dashboard push** —
  new in-process event bus (`src/lib/events.ts`, globalThis-pinned), `app/api/events/stream`
  endpoint, `run-complete` emit in `runStrategyOnce`, client `EventSource`; 30s blind poll
  demoted to 120s fallback. Live-verified push delivery (`subscribers:1`, `event: dirty`
  received). tsc clean, 233 tests, build green. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-push-vs-poll-vwap-sentiment-sse.md`.
- 2026-06-19: **UI expert audit and safety/readability polish**. A parallel
  UI/design, accessibility/responsive, and financial-products UX review plus
  live browser probing found first-run state ambiguity, mobile fixed-shell
  clipping, blank Market Scan empty states, raw activity JSON, and overstated
  symbol-drawer signal language. The active dashboard now shows `Setup Needed`
  instead of `Autonomy On` when account/universe prerequisites are missing,
  blocks Run/Resume through setup routing, exposes persistent Test/Paper/Brokerage mode,
  confirms live-mode switching, restores mobile page scrolling with a compact
  portfolio summary, replaces blank scan grids with actionable empty states,
  summarizes activity payloads, raises helper-text contrast, starts new defaults
  halted/propose, and sends LLMs `test/local` execution-mode context instead of
  ambiguous Paper-mode language. Dashboard charts now use SSR-safe SVG/CSS
  primitives plus a hydration shell so the Codex `next dev` preview serves `/`
  cleanly after build regeneration. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-ui-expert-audit-polish.md`.
- 2026-06-19: **Integration worktree scratch cleanup**. Added root-only ignore
  rules for manual screenshot captures, one-off UI probe scripts, and accidental
  SQL-named shell output files so the `main` integration checkout stays usable
  for review/fast-forward merges. Existing untracked scratch files in
  `~/Code/Agentic Trading` were classified as disposable local
  artifacts. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-integration-scratch-cleanup.md`.
- 2026-06-19 (`agent/claude`, committed): **Pinecone RAG fixed + backfilled (0→83
  vectors) and Robinhood MCP market data wired.** Root cause of the empty index was a
  swallowed Voyage 429 (billing) stacked on a latent **Pinecone v8 upsert bug** —
  `index.upsert(records)` must be `index.upsert({ records })` for
  `@pinecone-database/pinecone@8` (never fired before because Voyage 429'd first).
  `storeContexts` now audits its outcome; added `reindexEightKDataset` +
  `getVectorStoreStats` + dev-gated `POST /api/admin/reindex-8k`. Robinhood
  `get_equity_historicals` → OHLC cascade and `get_equity_fundamentals` → enrichment,
  inert until `ROBINHOOD_ADAPTER=mcp` + OAuth (adapter currently `mock`); verify shapes
  via `GET /api/admin/robinhood-probe`. **Also added: Alpaca free Benzinga news**
  (`AlpacaNewsEnrichmentProvider`, live in `MarketScan.source`) and **closed the HOUSE-congress
  gap** via an Apify `johnvc` actor adapter in `web-sources/congress.ts` (forced refresh =
  125 House + 61 Senate; House was 0). Verified: tsc clean, 233 tests (post-merge), build green, live
  backfill + congress refresh confirmed. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-pinecone-fix-and-robinhood-data-wiring.md`.
- 2026-06-19: **Market-data sharing/isolation guardrails**. Made the first
  broker/keyed market-data sharing decision explicit in code and docs: env-key/free
  OHLC history remains globally cached, saved user-key OHLC history is private by
  default, and `MARKET_DATA_SHARE_USER_KEYED_HISTORY=on` is required before user-keyed
  non-personal bars can enter the shared cache. Fixed broker quote source attribution
  so `mergeQuoteData` reports actual providers such as `alpaca-quotes` instead of
  always appending `robinhood-quotes`. Full verification passed:
  `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (231 tests), and a clean `npm run build`; the
  warmed Codex PM2 preview returned 200 for `/` and `/api/health`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-market-data-sharing-guardrails.md`.
- 2026-06-19: **Data-source failure hardening** for Capitol Trades, Voyage/Pinecone
  vector memory, and Massive S3 flat files. Capitol Trades' public BFF currently
  returns HTTP 503 HTML from this environment and the interactive site returns HTTP
  429 to local non-browser fetches; Senate eFD still works, and the secondary
  Capitol Trades adapter can now be disabled with `WEB_SOURCE_CAPITOLTRADES_URL=off`.
  SEC 8-K vector ingestion is capped and paced (`WEB_SOURCE_SEC8K_RAG_LIMIT`,
  `VECTOR_EMBED_*`) with 429 retry handling; after billing was added, a live
  `voyage-finance-2` probe succeeded with a 1024-dimension embedding, so the caps are
  now cost controls rather than emergency rate-limit workarounds. Massive S3 now
  prefers the dedicated S3 secret before the REST key, but live probes still return
  403 `NOT_AUTHORIZED`; Massive REST grouped bars remain healthy (12,299 rows for
  2026-06-18) and now share a `MASSIVE_REST_MAX_CALLS_PER_MINUTE=5` local budget for
  Basic/free-plan safety. Full
  verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (226 tests), and
  `npm run build`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-data-source-failure-hardening.md`.
- 2026-06-19: **UI UX Polish and Consistency Fixes**. Addressed bugs causing a blank market scan due to unhandled undefined Universe arrays. Improved UX by ensuring all Congressional/Insider symbols are clickable via `SymbolButton` utilizing synthetic quotes. Improved styling consistency of numeric parameters and simplified redundant top header metrics. Lightened the global dark mode theme and Command Palette backdrop for better readability. Fixed `onBlur` race conditions in Settings inputs and added a new UI to manage the symbol `blocklist`.
- 2026-06-19: **UI Polish & Policy Schema Refactoring**. Addressed the user's request to consolidate duplicate Strategy settings out of the Settings Modal and into the Strategy Tab. Implemented the composite Universe schema (`includedIndices` + `additionalSymbols`) and updated the "Universe" selection UX with an `EditableParam` $ / % toggle. Fixed resulting TypeScript errors in `dashboard-client.tsx`, `settings.tsx`, and `views.tsx`. `npm run build` is passing successfully.
- 2026-06-19: **Ops/observability/security foundation selected by user**. Added
  Infisical command wrappers, Gitleaks local + CI scans, Sentry Next.js runtime
  hooks, Langfuse LLM tracing with redacted summary capture by default, Dependabot
  config, Litestream SQLite backup/restore wrappers, and Playwright dashboard smoke
  tests. These are opt-in unless their env vars/host CLIs are configured. See
  `docs/ops-observability-security.md` and
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-ops-observability-security.md`.
- 2026-06-19: **Broker Connection UI Split**. Split the unified "Add Account" UI in the dashboard into distinct buttons for each broker (Alpaca vs Robinhood) and customized the editing form to only require API Keys/Secrets for Alpaca. This prevents user confusion since Robinhood uses an OAuth flow via the MCP server and Alpaca requires static keys. Full verification passed.
- 2026-06-19: **Composite Universe & System State Migration**. Replaced `universe`, `allowlist`, `enabled`, and `killSwitch` in `TradingPolicy` with a robust composite universe (`includedIndices`, `additionalSymbols`, `blocklist`) and a unified `systemState` (`active`, `halted`, `liquidating`, `close_only`). The policy engine, strategy runner, scheduler, tuning, and UI components were completely migrated. A new NAV-based sizing rule (`maxOrderPctOfNav`) was also introduced in the `DEFAULT_POLICY`. Full verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (223 tests), and `npm run build`.
- 2026-06-19: **Price chart timeframe controls and history expansion**. Added
  standard Yahoo Finance-style timeframe buttons (1D, 5D, 1M, 6M, YTD, 1Y, 5Y, All) 
  to the Symbol Drilldown price chart. Expanded the backend `fetchDailyOHLC`
  history fetch horizon from ~1.1 years to 5 years (1825 days) to support the
  longer timeframes. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-price-chart-timeframes.md`.
- 2026-06-19: **Ops/observability/security foundation selected by user**. Added
  Infisical command wrappers, local Gitleaks scanning, Sentry
  server/edge runtime hooks, Langfuse LLM tracing with redacted summary capture by
  default, npm Dependabot config, Litestream SQLite backup/restore wrappers, and
  Playwright dashboard smoke tests. GitHub CI/e2e/security workflows are deferred
  until push credentials include `workflow` scope. These are opt-in unless their
  env vars or host CLIs are configured. Browser Sentry/source-map upload is
  deferred until the Sentry build wrapper is revalidated. See
  `docs/ops-observability-security.md` and
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-ops-observability-security.md`.
- 2026-06-19: **Broker Connection UI Split**. Split the unified "Add Account" UI in the dashboard into distinct buttons for each broker (Alpaca vs Robinhood) and customized the editing form to only require API Keys/Secrets for Alpaca. This prevents user confusion since Robinhood uses an OAuth flow via the MCP server and Alpaca requires static keys. Full verification passed.
- 2026-06-19: **Composite Universe & System State Migration**. Replaced `universe`, `allowlist`, `enabled`, and `killSwitch` in `TradingPolicy` with a robust composite universe (`includedIndices`, `additionalSymbols`, `blocklist`) and a unified `systemState` (`active`, `halted`, `liquidating`, `close_only`). The policy engine, strategy runner, scheduler, tuning, and UI components were completely migrated. A new NAV-based sizing rule (`maxOrderPctOfNav`) was also introduced in the `DEFAULT_POLICY`. Full verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (223 tests), and `npm run build`.
- 2026-06-19: **Live-safety/risk-controls slice (Phase 10 E4/E5)**. Red Team
  review threshold is now a policy tuning knob (`redTeamConvictionThreshold`,
  default behavior 80), and `crisisMaxOpeningExposurePct` optionally caps new
  buy/short notional as a % of portfolio value when deterministic
  `entryMarketRegime` is crisis or inverted-curve. The cap is off when unset or
  <=0, and it does not block risk-reducing sells/covers. Focused tests cover the
  default/custom threshold and crisis-cap open-vs-exit behavior. Full verification
  passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (223 tests), and `npm run build`.
- 2026-06-19: **Durable skipped-candidate counterfactuals (Phase 10 B3)**.
  Skipped `signal_snapshot` evidence now materializes into
  `skipped_candidate_counterfactuals` with user-scoped watermarks, target dates,
  OHLC-derived exit prices, returns, dominant factors, sectors/regimes, and
  bulletins. Strategy runs trigger a bounded background refresh after writing the
  signal snapshot; matured rows feed `skippedCounterfactuals` before the
  current-scan fallback. Focused tests cover idempotency and user isolation. Full
  verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (223 tests), and
  `npm run build`.
- 2026-06-19: **Clickable tickers everywhere + symbol drawer reorder** (UI).
  Every standalone ticker (Decision proposals, Portfolio rail, Tax tables +
  red wash-sale lockout chips, Smart Money congress/insider) now opens the
  Symbol Intelligence drilldown — not just Market Scan rows. New `SymbolButton`
  (faint underline at rest, link-blue on hover; `chip` variant keeps red/box and
  goes bold-italic). Clicks resolve symbols against a live `/api/scan`
  (`tickerScan`) because `latestStrategyRun.marketScan` isn't rehydrated after a
  restart. Drawer reorder: Evidence Bulletins moved up, Source Provenance now
  full-width at the bottom. Feature code already landed in `8d5de0f`; verified
  `tsc` + `npm test` (210) + `npm run build`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-clickable-tickers-and-drawer-reorder.md`.
- 2026-06-19: Production-ops hardening attempted to add GitHub Actions CI for
  the required verification sequence, but GitHub rejected the push because the
  current OAuth credentials lack `workflow` scope. The workflow file is deferred
  until credentials are updated; local required verification still passed. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-ci-verification.md`.
- 2026-06-19: Broker/provider boundary cleanup tightened Alpaca, Robinhood, and
  enrichment-provider parsing with safer optional numeric/string handling, so
  missing upstream fields remain absent instead of leaking `NaN`, empty strings,
  or `"undefined"` into downstream data. `.air/` editor settings are now ignored.
  Full verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (223 tests), and
  `npm run build`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-broker-provider-type-cleanup.md`.
- 2026-06-18: Active dev is on branch **`phase-10`**, executing
  `docs/phase-10-signals-learning-ui-v2.md` (status markers in that doc are the
  source of truth for what's next). `phase-10`, `main`, and `origin/main` are
  aligned at `9bcf133`; the old standalone "merge web-sources → main" item is
  superseded. Shipped Phase 10 work now includes positioning re-score/re-sort,
  sector scorecard, full chosen+skipped EvidenceDigest, SEC 8-K item-enriched bulletins,
  market breadth/internals, expanded FRED/macro metrics, Fama-French, Cboe
  SKEW/VVIX, CFTC COT, technical signals, batched Voyage/Pinecone RAG scaffold,
  and symbol drilldown. Next highest leverage: D1/D2 prompt efficiency, B3/B4
  skipped-name/factor learning, E1/E2 completion, C5/C6 analyst/XBRL sources,
  and API-key routing from `docs/phase-11-multi-user.md`. Share-quantity policy is finalized: records keep
  full double precision; display = 3 sig figs OR all whole-number digits,
  whichever is larger, comma-grouped (`formatQuantity`; see
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-17-quantity-precision-display.md`). Git commits use the
  CLT workaround (`DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`) until the
  Xcode license is accepted. iCloud sync-conflict files (`"<name> 2.<ext>"`) are
  gitignored.
- Current publish branch packages the latest dashboard, cockpit UI,
  market-data, strategy, short/cover, and handoff-doc work for review.
- 2026-06-19: Robinhood MCP connection hardening landed as the first backlog
  slice from the external-app review. `src/lib/robinhood.ts` now defaults to the
  official Trading MCP endpoint, sends Streamable HTTP/SSE + protocol headers,
  parses JSON and SSE responses, unwraps Robinhood's `data` envelope, and exposes
  a `GET /api/broker/mcp/health` diagnostic route that checks auth and lists
  available tools. While verifying, narrow Phase 11 user-key plumbing was also
  aligned so API-key validation, Red Team, and post-mortem OpenAI calls remain
  buildable through `resolveApiKey`. UI status-card wiring is deferred to avoid
  colliding with concurrent account/settings changes in `app/dashboard-client.tsx`.
  Verified with `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (200 tests), and `npm run build`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-robinhood-mcp-transport.md`.
- 2026-06-19: Phase 10/11 continuation added Settings → API Keys with source-aware
  Set / Using env / Not set status, write-only masked save/clear controls, provider
  docs links, and a broadened `/api/keys` catalog. Major keyed paths now route
  through `resolveApiKey(service,userId)`: OpenAI strategy/tuning/red-team/
  post-mortem, enrichment providers, FRED macro/history, keyed OHLC, Massive
  breadth/news/flat-file helpers, SEC EDGAR UA, and Pinecone/Voyage. Strategy-run
  audit/daily-stat/fill/snapshot paths got narrower default-user scoping, and the
  Bull/Bear scan payload drops neutral empty fields. Verified with `npx tsc
  --noEmit`, `npm test` (201 tests), and `npm run build`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-api-key-routing-and-prompt-compaction.md`.
- 2026-06-19: Accounts modal now surfaces Robinhood MCP connection state from
  `GET /api/broker/mcp/health`, including adapter mode, endpoint/protocol,
  available tool names, refresh, and OAuth-connect action. Remaining mutable API
  routes touched by Accounts/API-key/order/policy flows are now explicitly
  dynamic so `next build` does not try to collect static page data for them. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-robinhood-mcp-status-card.md`.
- 2026-06-19: Phase 10/11 backend continuation added per-user strategy run locks,
  broader active-user discovery, user-scoped paper projections, scorecards,
  signal-efficacy joins, tax/wash-sale reads, notification audits, dashboard
  proposal/scheduler callbacks, and post-mortem reflection storage. Phase 10 now
  feeds `factorOutcomes` and high-return `skippedCounterfactuals` into the Bull
  prompt from existing `signal_snapshot` evidence, and the unsafe stateless
  portfolio/positions prompt omission was removed. Full combined-tree verification
  passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (210 tests), and `npm run build`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-phase-10-11-learning-isolation.md`.
- 2026-06-19: Phase 11 request-level user resolution scaffolding added
  `resolveRequestUserId(request, body?)`, reading `x-user-id`, then `userId`
  query/body hints, then falling back to `local`. High-impact API routes now pass
  the resolved user into existing user-aware policy, strategy, proposal,
  account, key, order, dashboard/scan, history/flat-file, audit, and profile
  paths. This preserves current no-auth dashboard behavior and does **not** mark
  authentication complete. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-request-user-resolution.md`.
- 2026-06-19: Added an opt-in, read-only `webull-unofficial` enrichment provider
  that shells out to `scripts/webull_unofficial_quote.py` only when
  `WEBULL_UNOFFICIAL_ENABLED` is explicitly enabled. It can source quote fields
  (`price`, bid/ask, intraday move, volume, 52-week range, name) with attribution,
  but does not log in, place orders, or produce learning-grade fills. The runtime
  subprocess path avoids static `child_process` imports so Next dev/instrumentation
  still compiles. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-webull-unofficial-market-data.md`.
- 2026-06-19: Added a Codex-owned dev launcher, `npm run dev:codex`, that pins
  Next dev to `127.0.0.1:3001` and frees only that port before starting. This
  keeps Codex browser checks isolated from Claude/local port-3000 sessions. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-19-codex-dev-port.md`.
- 2026-06-18: Fully utilized Massive (REST history primary in the OHLC cascade,
  full-market breadth, market news on the Macro tab, a bulk daily-bars route
  `GET /api/market/flatfile`, and a SigV4 S3 flat-file connector — signature
  verified, object download plan-gated). Split account management into a dedicated
  **Accounts** modal (out of Settings). Fixed a cold-start cache-poisoning bug so
  macro/breadth/history caches only store successful, non-empty results (breadth
  has its own 30-min success cache). Ran a two-track multi-agent platform review
  (UX + architecture/strategy/LLM) → `docs/reviews/2026-06-18-*.md` (verify/synth
  truncated by a session limit; reports reconstructed from the reviewers' findings).
  See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-18-massive-full-util-accounts-modal-review.md`.
- 2026-06-19: **Per-agent live-preview worktrees.** Each AI agent now works in its own
  git worktree on its own branch with its own PM2-hosted live `next dev` (HMR) on its own
  port — fully isolated `node_modules`/`.next`/`data`/`.env.local`, so one agent's edits or
  `npm run build` never touch another's preview or production: Claude →
  `~/apps/trading-claude` (`agent/claude`) :4100; Codex → `~/apps/trading-codex`
  (`agent/codex`) :4101; Antigravity → `~/apps/trading-antigravity` (`agent/antigravity`)
  :4102. `~/Code/Agentic Trading` (`main`) is the integration/merge worktree
  (no agent dev server). Production unchanged: pm2 `trading`, `next start` :4000. Bootstrap/
  repair with `scripts/setup-agent-previews.sh`; see the rewritten "Hosting & dev servers"
  section in `AGENTS.md`. Key rule: a running port is NOT a work lock — coordinate via git +
  STATUS.md only. (Supersedes the earlier single committed `trading-preview` :4100 idea.)
- **Data Optimization**: Market Scan candidates with a score < 40 are filtered out backend-side. The JSON payload is heavily minified (`symbol` -> `sym`, `marketCap` -> `mktCap`) to save LLM context window tokens.
- **Regime Detection**: The current market regime is deterministically evaluated using VIX and Fed rates, shifting the responsibility entirely from the LLM.
- **UI UX Polish**: The cockpit features interactive charting (Recharts Brush for panning/zooming), Sonner toasts for real-time action feedback, and dynamic lazy-loading for heavy bundle dependencies.

## Blockers / Open Questions
None. Phase 2 backend optimization is complete.
- 2026-06-16: completed a cockpit-UI optimization pass (presentation-only) —
  fixed the floating-alert positioning bug (now a bottom-right toast stack),
  added modal/tab accessibility (Escape, focus management, scroll-lock, ARIA),
  extracted ~400 lines of inline styles into CSS classes, and removed dead
  TS/CSS. Verified with `tsc` + `npm test` (80) + `npm run build`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-16-ui-optimization-pass.md`.
- 2026-06-16: LLM token + learning-loop pass — added an outcome-aware Thesis
  Scorecard (realized win/return/P&L per `tradeThesisTag`) fed to the Bull agent
  and reflection; gated the post-mortem so it only regenerates on new trades
  (saves a call + enables prompt caching); trimmed redundant prompt context
  (allowlist cap, slim recent orders, leaner Bear critique). Then deepened it:
  MAE/MFE excursion timing stats (`getExcursionsByThesis`), regime-conditioned
  outcomes (`getRegimeScorecard`), and delta-only macro pruning (`pruneMacro`).
  Adversarially reviewed (P&L/integration clean; one prompt-wording nit fixed).
  Verified with `tsc` + `npm test` (86) + `npm run build`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-16-llm-token-and-learning.md`.
- 2026-06-16: bottom drawer (Activity/Runs/Notifications) now has a per-tab
  minimum height (~2 entries) and a discoverable resize grip; content scrolls.
  See the resizable-bottom-drawer section in
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-16-ui-optimization-pass.md`.
- 2026-06-16 (branch `ui-redesign`): full presentation redesign into a themable
  dark/light "trading terminal" — Tailwind 4 + Recharts + Motion, command bar,
  Portfolio rail + tabbed workspace (Decision/Market/Performance/Strategy),
  feeds as a right slide-over, modal Settings/Strategy Studio, ⌘K palette, and a
  Recharts learning-loop visualization (P&L by thesis/regime). Data/agent layer
  unchanged (snapshot now also carries thesis/regime scorecards). `tsc` + 86
  tests + build pass. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-16-ui-redesign-tailwind.md`.
  Analyzed `RobinAgent-MCP`: a thin AI-Studio mockup — borrowed UI polish only;
  our agent engine is far ahead.
- 2026-06-16 (branch `ui-redesign`): US tax-mitigation features — wash-sale
  lockout guardrail (policy blocks rebuying a symbol sold at a loss within 30
  days), a Tax tab (ST/LT realized, estimated liability, wash-sale flags,
  tax-loss-harvest candidates, days-to-long-term), after-tax agent context, and
  Tax settings. New `src/lib/tax.ts`. `tsc` + 92 tests + build pass. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-16-tax-mitigation.md`. Estimates only — not tax advice.
- 2026-06-16 (branch `ui-redesign`): signals + learning-loop pass (tractable
  subset of Codex's "Stronger Trading Signals And Learning Loop" research plan).
  Plumbed five already-fetched-but-orphaned fields (`fcfYield`, `debtToEquity`,
  `epsGrowth`, `insiderSentiment`, `senateTrades`) end-to-end into factor scoring
  (`valueScore`/`qualityScore`), the agent prompt, and the Market Scan table
  (FCF% / D/E / EPS gr columns). Constrained `tradeThesisTag` to a fixed 10-tag
  `THESIS_PLAYBOOK` enum on both Bull + Bear schemas. Added Bayesian shrinkage
  (`shrunkWinRate`/`shrunkAvgReturnPct`, 5-trade neutral prior) to the
  thesis/regime scorecards. Added a `candidates_considered` audit logging chosen
  vs top-skipped scan candidates per run for future counterfactual learning.
  `tsc` + 93 tests + build pass. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-16-signals-learning.md`.
  Deferred to next phase: new providers (Alpha Vantage/FMP/SEC/FINRA/Cboe/FRED/
  Kenneth French), SignalSnapshot/EvidenceDigest layer, thesis×regime×sector×factor
  learning with a 20-lot gate, async digests.
- 2026-06-16 (branch `web-sources`, off merged `main`): backend **web-sources**
  subsystem + finished Codex learning-loop remainder. (a) Fixed a real bug — the
  scan enrichment merge dropped `fcfYield`/`debtToEquity`/`epsGrowth`/`senateTrades`,
  so the Phase-6 plumbing was dead; extracted `applyEnrichment` + fixed the summary
  projection. (b) New `src/lib/web-sources/`: a Senate eFD + Capitol Trades
  **congressional-trades** connector and a **SEC EDGAR Form 4** insider connector
  (open-market P/S only), polite cached fetch, persistent daily-refreshed datasets,
  scheduler hook, scan overlay (cache-only, no network in hot path), Congress scan
  column, `smartMoneyEvidence` prompt bulletins with front-running guidance. Never
  fabricates — sources down → no signal. (c) `signal_snapshot` audit per run;
  `getThesisRegimeScorecard` (thesis×regime) fed to the agent; **min-20-closed-lot
  gate** on auto-tuner factor-weight shifts. `tsc` + 113 tests + build pass; live
  scrapes verified (78 real congress trades; SEC parser on live filings). See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-16-web-sources-and-learning.md` and
  `docs/phase-9-web-sources.md`. This branch status is historical; the work is now
  included in the `phase-10`/`main` lineage.
- 2026-06-17: Phase 10 (E1) - Symbol Drilldown Drawer. Added a clickable row action to `MarketScanView` that slides out a `SymbolDrilldown` drawer. It now labels normalized 0-100 values as factor scores, not a true weighted waterfall. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-17-symbol-drilldown-drawer.md`.
- 2026-06-17: Alpaca Broker Integration. Added `@alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api` and native `AlpacaBrokerGateway` (`src/lib/alpaca.ts`). Scaffolded `user_api_keys` and getters/setters in `src/lib/db.ts` for multi-tenant keys. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-17-alpaca-integration.md`. Next up: Broker selection in UI and integrating into strategy runs.
- 2026-06-18: Multi-Account Architecture. Replaced the single-account toggle with a robust multi-account switcher in the UI. Added an `Integrations` tab to `SettingsModal` for adding/removing Robinhood and Alpaca accounts with their API keys. Modified `src/lib/db.ts` so `getPolicy` dynamically inherits `paperMode`, `accountNumber` and `activeBroker` from the active connected account, meaning execution and tracking are isolated to the active account without needing to refactor `runStrategyOnce`. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-18-multi-account-architecture.md`.
- 2026-06-18: **Technical-signal web source (Phase 10 A2.1)** — the first bar-based
  technical pipeline (RSI/MACD/MA crossovers), filling the stack's one signal gap. One
  per-symbol dataset, two interchangeable producers via `TECHNICAL_SOURCE`: **TradingView**
  push (Pine `alert()` → secret-gated `POST /api/webhooks/tradingview`) for the trial
  window, and **in-house computed** (free Yahoo/Stooq OHLC → `computeTechnicals`) as the
  durable free fallback. Overlays the scan, blends the `momentum` factor, joins the event
  union, emits bulletins, captured in the evidence digest. New `src/lib/indicators.ts`,
  `src/lib/web-sources/technical.ts`, the route, + 18 tests. `tsc` + **178 tests** + build
  green; webhook live smoke-tested (fixed a `node:crypto` dev-webpack break → `crypto`).
  Lighter `momentum`-blend used instead of a new ScoringWeights factor to avoid colliding
  with concurrent scoring edits. Operator guide: `docs/tradingview-pine-setup.md`. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-18-technical-signals-tradingview.md`. Not yet committed.
- 2026-06-18: **Price chart in the symbol drilldown** — TradingView **Lightweight Charts v5**
  (MIT, lazy-loaded) showing 1Y candlesticks + SMA50/200 + volume, themed via CSS vars, fed
  our own OHLC via new `GET /api/history`. Generalized the OHLC fetch into `src/lib/history.ts`
  with a **keyed-first cascade Tradier → Marketstack → Yahoo → Stooq** (free endpoints are
  blocked server-side: Yahoo 429, Stooq bot-challenge; Tradier/Marketstack keys work, 276
  bars). Technical `computed` producer refactored to reuse it. New `price-chart.tsx`,
  `history.ts`, route, +7 tests (188 total). Browser-verified (NVDA drilldown renders).
  **Open blocker (concurrent edit, not this work):** `src/lib/dashboard.ts:107` fails `tsc`
  — `computeMarketInternals` is fed a trimmed `latestStrategyRun.marketScan`; owner of the
  macro-internals work to resolve. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-18-price-chart-lightweight-charts.md`.
- 2026-06-18: **Voyage AI & Pinecone RAG Integration** — Replaced the stubbed RAG layer with 
  a production-ready integration using `voyage-finance-2` embeddings and Pinecone vector 
  database. Wired up the backend to asynchronously inject SEC 8-K filings into the vector DB 
  upon scraping. Integrated retrieval directly into `runStrategyOnce`, injecting top candidates' 
  financial context directly into the Bull Agent prompt. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-18-voyage-pinecone-rag.md`.
- 2026-06-18: **Glassmorphic UI Redesign** — Enhanced the UI aesthetics to a premium, modern 
  glassmorphism design. Updated `globals.css` with animated, vibrant mesh gradient backgrounds 
  and adjusted semantic design tokens (`--surface`, `--line`) to natively use translucent RGBA values. 
  This transforms all existing `bg-surface/50 backdrop-blur` classes across the app into genuine 
  beveled glass panels with inner white/dark highlights. Build is green. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-18-glassmorphism-ui.md`.
- 2026-06-18: **Multi-account credential hardening + UI clarity fixes** — fixed active-profile
  setting persistence (`user_settings`, not malformed `settings` writes), kept connected-account
  API keys server-only in dashboard snapshots, encrypted connected-account credentials at rest,
  preserved credentials when editing account metadata, made Alpaca use the selected connected
  account credentials, restored a command-bar "Manage Accounts..." escape hatch, and clarified
  symbol drilldown factor values as normalized 0-100 scores. `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`
  (**188 tests**), and `npm run build` pass after deleting stale `.next` output. Dev-server
  follow-up: local `next dev` hit repeated `EMFILE: too many open files, watch` warnings and an
  orphan port-3000 Node listener could not be stopped because escalation was rejected by the
  environment. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-18-multi-account-hardening-review.md`.
- 2026-06-18: **Markdown documentation audit** — read all repo-authored Markdown
  files (including `CLAUDE.md` symlink and ignored iCloud conflict copies, excluding
  `node_modules`, `.git`, and `.next`) and updated stale current docs. Notable
  findings: `README.md` still pointed to deleted `docs/HANDOFF.md`; Phase 10 was
  stale for later June 18 signal/RAG/UI work; Phase 9 still pointed at `CLAUDE.md`
  instead of `AGENTS.md`; Phase 1/8 needed clearer historical-vs-current framing.
  See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-18-markdown-doc-audit.md`.
- 2026-06-18: **Continuation hardening pass** — updated `.env.example` to match the
  expanded provider surface, fixed the Macro tab's dashboard internals path so it
  does not cast trimmed audit scans into full `MarketScan` data, passed `userId`
  through dashboard prompt/account/run/fill list reads, typed `webSources.technical`,
  and added regression tests proving the OHLC cascade uses Tradier first and
  Marketstack before free sources. See
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-18-keys-macro-panel-and-history-keys.md`.
- 2026-06-18: **RAG review resolution pass** — closed the prior review items around
  `src/lib/vector-db.ts`: the file is tracked; vector writes now use batched
  `storeContexts` with centralized Pinecone index initialization; SEC 8-K RAG
  context now includes item labels and SEC filing links; retrieved snippets are sent
  as dynamic `retrievedFinancialContext` in the user payload instead of the system
  prompt; `npm run dev` no longer force-kills port 3000 (`npm run dev:clean` is the
  explicit clean-start script). Added direct vector/SEC/strategy prompt tests. Full
  combined worktree verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (195 tests,
  27 files), `npm run build`. See `docs/rollouts/2026-06-18-rag-review-resolution.md`.
- Near-term engineering focus should be hardening Phase 7/8 before Live use:
  broker support confirmation, persistence/accounting checks, strategy-tuning
  tests, and better tests around short/cover and red-team debate behavior.

## Known Risks

- The worktree may be dirty. Check `git status` before assuming a clean base.
- `short` / `cover` support is partly implemented in policy and paper P&L, but
  Live use still needs broker-surface confirmation and persistence/accounting
  review, especially daily-notional tracking in `src/lib/db.ts`.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` can fail when `.next/types/**/*.ts` entries referenced by
  `tsconfig.json` are missing or stale. A fresh `npm run build` regenerates
  them.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` may report a pre-existing `mockFetcher` type mismatch in
  `test/alternative-data.test.ts` unless that file has been addressed directly.
- `npm run build` regenerates `.next/`; restart any running dev server after it.
- If the browser shows plain unstyled HTML, verify
  `/_next/static/css/app/layout.css` is returning `200`; if it returns `404`,
  restart the dev server on `127.0.0.1:3000`.
- If `next dev` repeatedly logs `EMFILE: too many open files, watch`, stop duplicate Node
  listeners on port `3000`, clean stale generated output only if needed, and restart with a
  higher file-descriptor limit or reduced watcher scope. Use `npm run dev:clean` only when
  intentionally clearing port 3000; `npm run dev` is non-destructive. A production
  `npm run build` remains the authoritative verification path.
