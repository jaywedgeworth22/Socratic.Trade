## Where things stand

**2026-08-02 — Mobile PWA owner-feedback round (Monet, cloud session).** Branch
`agent/antigravity/mobile-pwa-feedback` (applying patch from Monet): PWA gets
an Accounts section (switch broker account via `account.activate`, sign-out link to switch Google/Apple
login), per-proposal realtime approve/reject feedback (tapped button spins; card follows its queued
command through queued/running/succeeded/failed instead of failures hiding in the Command Log), and the
delete-account panel is collapsed behind a neutral link so it stops mimicking error banners. tsc clean,
mobile test file 10/10, lint 0 errors. Landed as #2351 (`44069368`).
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-mobile-pwa-owner-feedback.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Data-provider hardening pass (MONET, `monet/data-cascade-freshness`).**
Implemented the free-tier research doc's own recommendations: Tiingo now ALSO an
OHLC-history source in `history.ts` (was enrichment-only — a configured key delivered
none of the promised adjusted-history value until this landed), dead Stooq tier removed
(confirmed PoW-bot-walled), keyless Treasury.gov yield-curve fallback (3M/2Y/10Y +
curves, no FRED key needed), Cboe VIX9D, SEC-XBRL `revenueGrowth`. Full gates green.
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-data-provider-hardening.md`.

All 5 checks green, marked ready + squash auto-merge armed (AG pickup); branch updated with main 2026-08-02 to satisfy the strict up-to-date rule — lands on the re-run's green.

| Deploy mechanism | auto-deploy on push to `main` — **repaired 2026-08-02** (webhook HMAC secret was mismatched; see blocker 1) |
| Core trading health | DB ok, scheduler ticking, 3 active accounts / 0 degraded, litestream replicating |

## Blockers

1. **RESOLVED 2026-08-02 — auto-deploy was broken by a webhook HMAC mismatch.** Every push
   to `refs/heads/main` was answered by Coolify with
   `[{"status":"failed","message":"Invalid signature."}]` (visible only in the GitHub hook
   delivery RESPONSE BODY — the hook page showed green 200s throughout), so no deployment
   was ever created; the queue sat empty and the single 2026-08-01 deploy was the owner's
   manual click. Repair: synced the GitHub hook secret to the Coolify app's
   `manual_webhook_secret_github`, deleted the exact-duplicate second hook, redelivered the
   newest main push -> a real deployment was created immediately, and
   `scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh 19dfd51b` reported **PASS** (~04:47Z). Merge==live is
   trustworthy again. Also fixed: AGENTS.md's stale Coolify uuid (the app is `socratic-app`
   now). Full receipts + recurrence warning:
   `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-deploy-webhook-secret-repair.md`.

2. **RESOLVED — npm `EALLOWSCRIPTS` on the shared git dep (and the earlier explanation
   here was wrong).** A clean-shell reproduction with the repo's exact files PASSES: the
   repo as committed installs fine, and a stale `allowScripts` tag was NOT the trigger.
   The real triggers (npm 11.16.0+, upstream bug npm/cli#9783, open, unfixed through npm
   12.0.2): an `allow-scripts=...` line in ANY `.npmrc` layer, or an inherited
   `npm_config_allow_scripts` env var — npm forwards it into its git-dep preparation
   subprocess, which rejects it as a flag. This Mac had live `npx`-launched processes
   exporting `npm_config_allow_scripts=@wasp.sh/wasp-cli`; any shell descending from that
   lineage fails every `npm ci` instantly. If EALLOWSCRIPTS appears: check
   `env | grep npm_config_allow_scripts` and relaunch the contaminated parent — and NEVER
   add `allow-scripts` to `.npmrc`, even though npm's own error message suggests it.
   Also fixed forward: `allowScripts` git-dep keys in tag form (`#vX.Y.Z`) can never match
   (npm compares against the resolved 40-char SHA), which npm 12 escalates from a warning
   to a hard block on the dep's `prepare` — the key is now committish-free
   (`"github:jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared": true`, verified: coverage warning
   gone). #2345's lockfile regen also fixed a real silent bug: the old lockfile pinned the
   v2.3.0 commit while package.json said v2.4.x, so `npm ci` was silently shipping the old
   shared package. Verified 2026-08-02: plain `npm ci` = exit 0, 575 packages, clean shell.
   (An earlier copy of this blocker blamed a stale `allowScripts` tag — corrected above;
   the union merge briefly duplicated both versions here, de-spliced 2026-08-02.)

3. **Two provider lanes are degraded and need an owner decision, not an agent fix.**
   FMP's plan probe returns 403 (subscription state) and Massive is history-capped to the
   free tier. Agents must not provision replacement keys. Several optional/telemetry lanes
   (Usage Monitor, VIX-Yahoo, Nasdaq Quote, some RapidAPI lanes) are also down; those are
   fallback tiers and the cascade still serves real data.

## Next action

- Watch that `c117afb9` (and subsequent merges) deploy organically via the repaired
  webhook — `bash scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh` after merging.
- (Retracted: the `schedulerLease.owner` "residual" flagged earlier does not exist — the
  landed code already strips the pid for unauthenticated callers; prod serves the bare
  instance uuid. Observation was made against the pre-deploy payload.)
- Owner decisions pending: FMP subscription, Massive plan tier; and whether hook-secret
  re-sync should be added to the Coolify app-recreate recipe (see the 2026-08-02 rollout
  note — if recreation regenerated the secret, this failure recurs on the next recreate).

## Conventions that bite (do not re-derive these)

- **Board files are `merge=union`.** `.gitattributes` union-merges `STATUS.md`,
  `PLAN.md`, and `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` so concurrent PRs do not conflict on them. The cost
  is that union **interleaves** both sides instead of conflicting, which silently produces
  duplicated rows and entries spliced under the wrong heading. `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` had 13
  exact-duplicate blocks from this (deduped 2026-08-01) and `STATUS.md` had one agent's
  notes filed under another's heading (preserved as evidence in `docs/status-archive.md`).
  Keep entries to a single line where you can, and re-read your own row after a merge.
- **Node 24 is required.** The Mac's default `node` is v26 and mass-fails the suite on a
  `better-sqlite3` ABI mismatch. Prefix gate commands with
  `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@24/bin:$PATH"`.
