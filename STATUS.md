## Current (2026-08-09 MONET — "Pinecone connection failed / database is locked" mislabel)

**Branch `monet/pinecone-lock-mislabel` (commit-only; landing operator lands):** the hourly
owner-visible push titled "Pinecone connection failed" with body `inventory fetch: database is
locked` was OUR SQLite, not Pinecone. Root cause: `settleProviderDispatch`
(`src/lib/db-provider-dispatch.ts`) opened a DEFERRED transaction that SELECTs before it UPDATEs,
so promoting the WAL read snapshot to a write returns `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT` ("database is
locked") instantly WITHOUT consulting `busy_timeout` — which is why the 60s ceiling never absorbed
it; every ledger transaction now opens `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (repro receipts in the rollout note).
Second fix: new `src/lib/local-db-fault.ts` classifies local-SQLite failure signatures, and
`withRagApiHealth` no longer writes a provider failure row or a `provider_degraded` push for them —
it records a `local_db_contention` audit row and, past 5 occurrences in 6h, ONE advisory titled
"Storage Warning: local database contention" (never a vendor name); `alertConnectionFailure` gets
the same guard for non-RAG lanes. Real Pinecone HTTP/network errors behave exactly as before.
Gates: tsc clean; 22 test files / 236 tests green (new `test/local-db-fault-classification.test.ts`
7/7, both new assertions verified to fail without the fix); lint 0 errors. Rollout:

## Current (2026-08-09 MONET — durable embed stage: embed-once guarantee)

**Branch `monet/embed-stage` (stacked on `monet/pinecone-wu-breaker` / PR #2596; commit-only —
landing operator lands):** owner directive — a paid OpenRouter document embedding must never be
paid for twice. New SQLite `embed_stage` table (durable L2 under the process-local L1 cache):
`storeContextsImpl` persists each paid vector (Float32 BLOB, keyed
content_hash-of-embed-input + model + embed-rev) AFTER provider validation and BEFORE the
Pinecone upsert; upsert success deletes the rows (managed commits defer to after
markCommitted); upsert failure keeps them and every retry path replays them with ZERO provider
calls — durable across restarts. WU-breaker gate still blocks everything (incl. stage-consume)
until it lifts; stage replays on resume. Retention: 35d orphan sweep + 2 GiB oldest-first cap in
the daily audit-prune lane. Receipts: `embed_stage_replay` audit (embeds avoided per store call),
`embedsFromStage` on results + lastIngest. Gates: tsc clean; 33 test files / 376 tests green

## Current (2026-08-09 MONET — Pinecone monthly WU exhaustion breaker)

upserts 429 hourly on the exhausted 2M/month write-unit quota (10-K backfill), re-embedding
the same docs through paid OpenRouter every cycle. New breaker: detection in
`withRagApiHealth` trips a marker (`pinecone:wuExhaustedUntil` = 1st of next month UTC,
ONE storage_warning + audit, health row soft `[expected-limit]`), early gate in
`storeContexts`/`storeDocument` refuses writes BEFORE any embed spend
(`wuExhausted` typed skip, ≤1 audit/day), sec_ingest tasks park cleanly via new
`deferSecIngestTask` (retry_wait at marker expiry, stage attempt refunded — no retry storm
or dead-letter), sec-filings bulk loop stops at the first gated filing. Auto-clears on
expiry AND on any successful Pinecone write (plan upgrade); Connections pinecone lane shows
yellow `LIMIT` "monthly write units exhausted · resumes <date>" instead of red STOPPED.
Gates: tsc clean; 16 test files / 201 tests green (incl. new

**MONET (this seat; posts earlier today were tagged CLAUDE before the owner re-ruled the seat) ran the owner-requested full-product review** (live signed-in prod session +
12-agent workflow): findings in `docs/reviews/2026-08-06-claude-full-product-review.md`,
handoff in `docs/rollouts/2026-08-06-claude-full-product-review.md`, issues labeled
`product-review-2026-08-06`. Highest-urgency discoveries:

- **Deploy freeze (P0): all five 2026-08-06 deploys failed** — Coolify's SSH exec stream
  dies mid-build (exit 255, "disconnected by user"), correlated with CT OCR load on the
  shared box; prod sat on `6b47a886` while main advanced 4 merges. Zombie helper
  `onlrw5mgf4s2pw9he4udt2kg` (13.5h) removed; webhook redelivered; retry on a quiet box
  progressed past every earlier failure point (see rollout note for final status).
- **Litestream→R2 was PAUSED (P0)** since Aug 4 (free-tier kill-switch). **Superseded
  2026-08-07 GROK:** active replica → **Backblaze B2** (see Current header); R2 left
  historic. Cross-app R2 free-tier noise may still alert but must not stop B2 backups.
- **Results page shows +56.47% vs SPY on a flat account (P1)** — phantom inferred
  $36.5k withdrawal + SPY series silently 0.00% everywhere; and the tax open-lots ledger
  contradicts live positions (T long 91 sh vs actual short −1.881). Overlaps GROK's
  `grok/fix-account-return-pct`.
- **Two unmanaged shorts (P1)**: PG/T shorts sit unprotected because every enforcement
  layer skips shorts while `shortSellingEnabled` is off (`app/console/lib/derive.ts`).
- **Shared-package drift (P1)**: manifest pins `congress-trading-shared#v2.5.1`, lockfile
  ships 2.5.0 — the filingDate member-skill dependency is not actually deployed.

## 2026-08-05 GROK — multi-period TWR

## 2026-07-06 — Learned-context copy fix + browse/delete archive (CLAUDE, `agent/claude`)
Owner flagged awkward empty-state copy on the Learned Context approval queue and asked why the AI
doesn't auto-learn and let the user review/delete afterward. Answer: it mostly already does — the
`fact` tier is silent passthrough, never queued; only `risk`/`strategy-directive` (numeric limits,
sizing, leverage, authority) confirms first, and that's deliberate (ingested-document/inference
safety, not paternalism — see `docs/chat-multiuser-learning-design.md`). What was genuinely
missing: the "browse + delete what was silently learned" surface the design doc promised but never
built. Shipped both: reworded the empty-state copy; added `deleteLearnedContext` (ownership-scoped,
also the shared-contribution erasure path) in `src/lib/db-learning.ts`, new `GET
/api/learned-context` + `DELETE /api/learned-context/[id]` routes, client helpers, and a new
collapsed-by-default `LearnedFactsArchive` browse/delete component in
`app/console/approvals/learned-context.tsx` wired into the approvals page. New
`test/learned-context-delete.test.ts` (7 tests: ownership isolation, foreign-user 404, shared-row
erasure, audit trail, superseded-row exclusion). 8-angle adversarial review found no
correctness/security bugs (two correctness-adjacent candidates investigated and refuted with
concrete evidence — see rollout note). Branch had drifted far behind `origin/main`
(Coolify/Hetzner migration, mobile fixes, RAG/sizing/prompt-safety work); merged by hand after
reviewing every flagged overlap, re-verified full quartet on the merged tree: tsc clean, lint 0
errors, 283 files / 2843 tests green, build clean. **Merged as PR #998** (`1c0c20d3`).
**Deployed to production** 2026-07-06 21:30:29Z via `~/apps/trading-publish.sh` — verified

## Where things stand

**2026-08-04 — Multi-Source Quote Cascade & Staleness Resolution (ANTIGRAVITY).** Implemented a 5-level redundant quote cascade resolving active broker gateway → Alpaca snapshots → Yahoo batch → Yahoo single → ROIC.ai profile. Converted the quote staleness policy check into a non-blocking gate that mutates opening orders to limit orders to defend the price (buy capped at min(limit, ref), short capped at max(limit, ref)), appends warning text to rationale, writes a `quote_staleness_warn` audit trail, and alerts the user via `provider_degraded` push. Full tests and builds check out clean. Rollouts: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-multi-source-quote-cascade.md`, `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-non-blocking-quote-staleness-gate.md`.
**2026-08-04 — Multi-Source Quote Cascade & Staleness Resolution (ANTIGRAVITY).** Added a redundant multi-source quote cascade in `src/lib/quotes-cascade.ts` checking broker quotes, Alpaca snapshots, Yahoo batch, and Yahoo single quote APIs in series. Integrated it across the strategy run loop, proposal approvals, and chat draft promotion. Added a unit test suite to verify the cascade level routing. Full type check and lints pass. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-multi-source-quote-cascade.md`.

**2026-08-04 — EOD Quote History Cache SQLite Migration (ANTIGRAVITY).** Migrated the legacy flat-file JSON EOD quote caching (`data/history-5y/`, etc.) in `src/lib/history.ts` to a fully SQLite-backed table `history_cache_eod` to resolve test failures and ensure robust silent-caching. Replaced `fetchLocalFlatFileHistory` with `fetchHistoryCacheEod`. Updated the `test/history.test.ts` suite to seed the SQLite DB directly. Full tests pass. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-history-cache-eod-migration.md`.

**2026-08-03 — Subdomain Host Routing & EOD Quote Caching Upgrade (ANTIGRAVITY, branch `agent/antigravity`).** Added `mobile.socratictrade.com` $\rightarrow$ `/mobile` and `console.socratictrade.com` $\rightarrow$ `/console` host-level routing in `middleware.ts`. Upgraded EOD price history in `src/lib/history.ts`: added `isBarSeriesFresh` staleness detection, `mergeOHLCBars` merging for stale flat files, auto-persistence of fresh provider bars into SQLite `imported_price_eod` and disk, and `eod_cache_stale` audit logging. All gates green (`tsc`, `lint`, vitest 27/27, Next.js `build`). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-eod-quote-caching-and-subdomain-routing.md`.

**2026-08-03 — iOS/mobile account switch hangs (MONET, branch `monet/ios-account-switch-fix`).**
Owner screenshots: Roth IRA spinner stuck, Sandbox still Active, Home stale + 2 queued · 1
running. Root cause: `account.activate` waited on the global sequential mobile worker behind
`strategy.run_once`, and clients also blocked switch when the snapshot was stale. Fix: run
`account.activate` immediately (same path as stop), allow switch on stale snapshot (iOS + PWA),
clear iOS busy spinner from the terminal POST before snapshot reload. Focused mobile tests
16/16; full gates via land.sh. Rollout:
`docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-ios-account-switch-immediate.md`.
**2026-08-03 — Console RAG Evidence Card Deduplication (ANTIGRAVITY, branch `agent/antigravity/mobile-pwa-feedback`).** Fixed duplicate RAG evidence rendering (`sec-edgar` and `Retrieved 10 K` cards showing identical document receipt & score) in proposal drawer by deduplicating RAG attributions against `decision.evidence` in `deriveEvidenceRows` (`app/console/page.tsx`). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-dedupe-evidence-cards.md`.

**2026-08-03 — Console dashboard `topCandidates.slice` white-screen (GROK, branch
`agent/grok-fix-dashboard-topcandidates`).** Owner report: main `/console` showed
`Dashboard error` / `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'r.topCandidates.slice')`.
Root cause: `deriveEvidenceRows` assumed every truthy `latestScan` had array
`topCandidates`. Fix: `safeTopCandidates` + snapshot normalization in `dashboard.ts`.
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-console-topcandidates-slice-crash.md`.

**2026-08-03 — Xcode App Settings & Apple Sign-In Layout Constraint Fix (ANTIGRAVITY).** Configured Xcode App Category (`public.app-category.finance`), Display Name (`Socratic.Trade`), Marketing Version (`1.0.0`), and Build Version (`1`) across `Info.plist` and `project.pbxproj`. Fixed `ASAuthorizationAppleIDButton` layout constraint collision warning (`width == 392` vs `width <= 375`) in `LoginView.swift` by capping `SignInWithAppleButton` width to 375pt. `xcodebuild` succeeded clean. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-xcode-app-settings-and-apple-signin-constraint-fix.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Exit-0 outage root-caused + exit-code hardening (MONET, branch
`monet/exit0-outage-audit`).** The 15:29Z "clean exit 0, stayed down" outage was an
**unpaired docker-API stop**, with the 0 fabricated by a pid-1 signal-re-raise bug in the
infisical wrappers plus in-container npm swallowing SIGTERM (sandbox-reproduced in the
real image; every deploy had been hard-killing next-server). Fixed: wrappers exit 128+N,
boot script now supervises the app (spontaneous clean exit → 40, every exit logged,
`node_modules/.bin/next start` direct — npm banned from the exec chain), new
production-gated `src/lib/exit-guard.ts` re-tags spontaneous in-app exit(0) → 43 with
call-site receipts. Restart policy is already `unless-stopped` — evaluated, **no flip**
(it restarts any spontaneous exit; the outage class is API stops, now covered by rule +
honest codes). `docker events` forensics verified broken (~256-event ring ≈ minutes on
this box) — journalctl is the durable source. Contract + traps codified in AGENTS.md
("Production exit-code contract"). Rollout:
`docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-exit0-outage-audit.md`. Next prod stop/deploy should log
`app exited with code 143 after forwarded SIGTERM` as live confirmation.

**2026-08-02 — 5-Year Local Flat-File Price History Priority (ANTIGRAVITY).** Added `fetchLocalFlatFileHistory(symbol)` as the #1 primary tier in `src/lib/history.ts` (`fetchDailyOHLC`) and `fetchGroupedBarsLocal(date)` in `src/lib/market-signals/massive.ts`. Any pre-hoarded 5-year Massive flat files (`data/history-5y/`, `data/massive-history/`) are read directly from disk without hitting external REST APIs, providing instant zero-cost history for backtests and Congress.Trade EOD price feeds (`/api/market/prices/[symbol]`, `/api/market/spx`). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-local-flatfile-history-priority.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Mobile PWA owner-feedback round (Monet, cloud session).** Branch
`agent/antigravity/mobile-pwa-feedback` (applying patch from Monet): PWA gets
an Accounts section (switch broker account via `account.activate`, sign-out link to switch Google/Apple
login), per-proposal realtime approve/reject feedback (tapped button spins; card follows its queued
command through queued/running/succeeded/failed instead of failures hiding in the Command Log), and the
delete-account panel is collapsed behind a neutral link so it stops mimicking error banners. tsc clean,
mobile test file 10/10, lint 0 errors. Landed as #2351 (`44069368`).
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-mobile-pwa-owner-feedback.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Data-provider hardening, Round 1 (MONET, `monet/data-cascade-freshness`,
merged as #2353).** Implemented the free-tier research doc's own recommendations: Tiingo
now ALSO an OHLC-history source in `history.ts` (was enrichment-only — a configured key
delivered none of the promised adjusted-history value until this landed), dead Stooq tier
removed (confirmed PoW-bot-walled), keyless Treasury.gov yield-curve fallback (3M/2Y/10Y +
curves, no FRED key needed), Cboe VIX9D, SEC-XBRL `revenueGrowth`. Full gates green.
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-data-provider-hardening.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Data-provider hardening, Round 2/3 (MONET, `monet/data-cascade-providers-round2`).**
Closes out the rest of the same research doc: 3 new key-gated fundamentals/news providers
(Wisesheets, SimFin, Marketaux — all dormant until their env key is set), 2 new keyless
sources (BLS macro fallback wired into the Macro board, Nasdaq earnings-calendar backfill),
an S&P 500 constituents mirror (built, not yet wired to replace the static universe list —
see the rollout note), Yahoo 429 hardening, and Alpha Vantage/Finnhub earnings-calendar
fallbacks. USAspending.gov investigated and correctly NOT implemented (no free
recipient→ticker crosswalk exists). Full gates green: lint 0 errors, tsc clean, 5891/5891
tests, build clean. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-data-provider-round2.md`.

## Blockers

1. **RESOLVED 2026-08-02 — auto-deploy was broken by a webhook HMAC mismatch.** Every push
   to `refs/heads/main` was answered by Coolify with
   `[{"status":"failed","message":"Invalid signature."}]` (visible only in the GitHub hook
   delivery RESPONSE BODY — the hook page showed green 200s throughout), so no deployment
   was ever created; the queue sat empty and the single 2026-08-01 deploy was the owner's
   manual click. Repair: synced the GitHub hook secret to the Coolify app's
   `manual_webhook_secret_github`, deleted the exact-duplicate second hook, redelivered the
   newest main push -> a real deployment was created immediately, and
   `scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh 19dfd51b` reported **PASS** (~04:47Z). Merge==live is
   trustworthy again. Also fixed: AGENTS.md's stale Coolify uuid (the app is `socratic-app`
   now). Full receipts + recurrence warning:
   `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-deploy-webhook-secret-repair.md`.

2. **RESOLVED — npm `EALLOWSCRIPTS` on the shared git dep (and the earlier explanation
   here was wrong).** A clean-shell reproduction with the repo's exact files PASSES: the
   repo as committed installs fine, and a stale `allowScripts` tag was NOT the trigger.
   The real triggers (npm 11.16.0+, upstream bug npm/cli#9783, open, unfixed through npm
   12.0.2): an `allow-scripts=...` line in ANY `.npmrc` layer, or an inherited
   `npm_config_allow_scripts` env var — npm forwards it into its git-dep preparation
   subprocess, which rejects it as a flag. This Mac had live `npx`-launched processes
   exporting `npm_config_allow_scripts=@wasp.sh/wasp-cli`; any shell descending from that
   lineage fails every `npm ci` instantly. If EALLOWSCRIPTS appears: check
   `env | grep npm_config_allow_scripts` and relaunch the contaminated parent — and NEVER
   add `allow-scripts` to `.npmrc`, even though npm's own error message suggests it.
   Also fixed forward: `allowScripts` git-dep keys in tag form (`#vX.Y.Z`) can never match
   (npm compares against the resolved 40-char SHA), which npm 12 escalates from a warning
   to a hard block on the dep's `prepare` — the key is now committish-free
   (`"github:jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared": true`, verified: coverage warning
   gone). #2345's lockfile regen also fixed a real silent bug: the old lockfile pinned the
   v2.3.0 commit while package.json said v2.4.x, so `npm ci` was silently shipping the old
   shared package. Verified 2026-08-02: plain `npm ci` = exit 0, 575 packages, clean shell.
   (An earlier copy of this blocker blamed a stale `allowScripts` tag — corrected above;
   the union merge briefly duplicated both versions here, de-spliced 2026-08-02.)

3. **Two provider lanes are degraded and need an owner decision, not an agent fix.**
   FMP's plan probe returns 403 (subscription state) and Massive is history-capped to the
   free tier. Agents must not provision replacement keys. Several optional/telemetry lanes
   (Usage Monitor, VIX-Yahoo, Nasdaq Quote, some RapidAPI lanes) are also down; those are
   fallback tiers and the cascade still serves real data.

## Next action

- Watch that `c117afb9` (and subsequent merges) deploy organically via the repaired
  webhook — `bash scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh` after merging.
- (Retracted: the `schedulerLease.owner` "residual" flagged earlier does not exist — the
  landed code already strips the pid for unauthenticated callers; prod serves the bare
  instance uuid. Observation was made against the pre-deploy payload.)
- Owner decisions pending: FMP subscription, Massive plan tier; and whether hook-secret
  re-sync should be added to the Coolify app-recreate recipe (see the 2026-08-02 rollout
  note — if recreation regenerated the secret, this failure recurs on the next recreate).

## Conventions that bite (do not re-derive these)

- **Board files are `merge=union`.** `.gitattributes` union-merges `STATUS.md`,
  `PLAN.md`, and `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` so concurrent PRs do not conflict on them. The cost
  is that union **interleaves** both sides instead of conflicting, which silently produces
  duplicated rows and entries spliced under the wrong heading. `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` had 13
  exact-duplicate blocks from this (deduped 2026-08-01) and `STATUS.md` had one agent's
  notes filed under another's heading (preserved as evidence in `docs/status-archive.md`).
  Keep entries to a single line where you can, and re-read your own row after a merge.
- **Node 24 is required.** The Mac's default `node` is v26 and mass-fails the suite on a
  `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@24/bin:$PATH"`.

**2026-08-04 — Model slug migration tests and UI mapping fixes (Antigravity).**
Fixed `gpt-5.4-mini` regex inclusion in reasoning model capabilities which was causing test suite failures under Node 24. Also cleaned up `MODEL_DISPLAY_NAME` in `app/console/lib/models.ts` to strictly follow user-provided slugs, completely removing any legacy `-latest` suffixes. Verified tests locally.

**2026-08-04 — Revert accidental marketScan in from-draft preview (Antigravity).**
Fixed `test/chat-draft-policy.test.ts` test regression. A previous commit accidentally added a `fetchFreshQuotesCascade` call to the preview evaluation in `app/api/proposals/from-draft/route.ts`. Since the mock test broker returns real time quotes, this caused the "scan-less" preview to actually fetch a fresh quote and skip the expected `staleness_gate` block in tests. Reverted the addition so the preview returns to its scan-less state. All 10/10 tests pass, `land.sh` executed.
