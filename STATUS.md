## 2026-08-20 CLAUDE — ST->CT price service (PR pending, DO NOT MERGE YET)

FMP is banned for market data (owner ruling 2026-08-20); it stays valid only as a
latency-race competitor being timed.  New `src/lib/market-realtime.ts` plus token-gated
peer routes `/api/market/quotes` and `/api/market/intraday/[symbol]` replace it for CT.
Intraday bars are the important half: CT schedules snapshots retrospectively, so a live
quote can never honestly answer a past due-time.  Robinhood first, Alpaca fallback,
delayed Yahoo opt-in and flagged.  ROIC rejected (daily-only, 4h cache).

Gates: lint 0 errors, tsc clean, 639 files / 7191 tests, build ok.

BLOCKER: production recovered from the 08:17Z outage on the LAST GOOD IMAGE (77d7d7b6)
and is four merges behind origin/main.  Do not add a build to that queue until it
catches up.  Receipt: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-ct-price-service.md`.

# Current Handoff

## 2026-08-20 MONET - `pnl-basis-labels` up for review

Every performance number now says what it measures.  Basis and window travel with the value through `performance.ts` / `benchmark.ts` to both the console and iOS, so "Unrealized P&L" stops meaning three different things across Results, Home and the phone; an empty sample reads as no-data rather than a confident `0%`; and mark-to-market sums a book with shorts on `|basis|` instead of netting short against long (`costBasis` changed meaning net -> gross; identical for an all-long book, and the single consumer was grep-confirmed).  `-` (unavailable) vs `n/a` (computed no-ratio) preserved.

**Not closed, stated openly:** `perf-17` - the SPY benchmark is total-return or price-return depending on which history provider answered, and an intraday tip is compared against an EOD close.  Confirmed by reading the provider cascade, not papered over; normalising that is its own change.  Also open: the coach tool context still passes raw win rate with no sample count.

Gate: lint 0 errors, tsc clean, 7140 tests, build 0, `xcodebuild build` 0.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-pnl-basis-labels.md`.
## 2026-08-20 CURSOR-BUGBOT — owner-cancel protective-stop tombstone on lookup miss

`cancelWorkingOrder` only tombstoned an owner-cancelled app-managed stop when the advisory pre-cancel broker read returned the order.  Console cancel is fail-open on that read (timeout, throw, or a working GTC stop missing from scoped `getEquityOrders`).  The broker cancel still ran, but `cancelledSymbol` stayed empty, so the do-not-replace tombstone and `broker_protective_stops` delete were skipped.  The next reconcile tick then treated the cancelled stop as a stale resting row and re-placed protection the owner had just removed.

Fix: take the symbol from the tracked `broker_protective_stops` row when the lookup has no order.  Did not touch #2861.  Did not change cancel fail-open doctrine.

**IN PR #2949.**  Branch `cursor/owner-cancel-stop-tombstone-lookup`.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-owner-cancel-stop-tombstone-lookup.md`.

## 2026-08-20 MONET - `prompt-trust-boundary` up for review

Untrusted content can no longer reach the always-trusted strategy prompt unlabelled.  The trust boundary now lives AT THE SINK: `mergeStrategyDirectiveBlock` requires `source`, runs containment itself and returns `{ prompt, contained }`, so a future caller cannot write an unscanned directive by forgetting a helper (the required parameter proved itself by breaking the one stale 4-arg call site at compile time).  Coach URL lessons are contained at ingest and dropped + audited on a real hijack idiom; the forgeable unauthenticated `POST /api/chat-history` is deleted; a `MockLLM` semantic-gate fallback is audited instead of silent; the revalidation rationale is contained and the reviewer prompt carries a data-not-command clause.

**Owner text is never altered** - containment keys on provenance, so `owner-coach` passes byte-for-byte.  `learningReviewMode: "decide"` auto-apply and `learningReviewEnabled` are untouched: the second review round established that as an owner choice with an existing off-switch, and re-gating it would be paternalism.  Gate: lint 0 errors, tsc clean, 7146 tests, build 0.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-prompt-trust-boundary.md`.

## 2026-08-20 MONET — `web-ios-contract-drift` up for review, and main's iOS test target is RED

Contract fixture now pins `GET /api/policy` to the Swift `FullPolicy` decoder from both sides, so a rename fails CI instead of silently blanking a phone list.  `api-01` was already fixed on main by #2863 mid-flight, so this branch drops its competing decode and keeps main's.  **`qa-04` (a `/api/mobile/snapshot` contract test) is still OPEN.**

**Unrelated breakage found:** `xcodebuild test` does not compile on a clean `origin/main` - `ios/SocraticTradeTests/MobileModelsTests.swift:403/425/445` call `JSONEncoder().encode()` on a non-`Encodable` type (5 errors; that file arrived in #2863).  The app builds fine; only the test target is red, and the required gate never runs it, so it went unnoticed - findings `qa-01`/`qa-02` exactly.  Reported to the fleet, not claimed.  Until it is repaired, Swift contract assertions ship committed but unrunnable.

## 2026-08-19 MONET — `per-account-visibility` landed for review (tranche-1 cluster)

Screens no longer label one account's data as every account's.  Broker rows in Settings read real per-account policy state and a real per-account pending count (both were previously the active account's, with every other row mislabelled "Inactive" even while trading, and the count dead code that always read 0); the decisions index keeps its by-design all-accounts fetch and gains an account chip; `mobileCommandBacklog` was global across USERS and is now user-scoped.  Each finding was classified wrong-scope vs wrong-label before fixing, so a wrong query is never papered over with a label change.  Full gate green (lint 0 errors, tsc clean, 7071 tests, build 0).

## 2026-08-19 MONET — Full-app review Part II: adversarial re-verify + gap coverage + deduped fix plan

`docs/reviews/2026-08-18-full-app-expert-review.md` now carries Part II.  Second round re-attacked all 40 P1s: **27 upheld with a proven repro, 11 narrowed, 2 already fixed, 0 refuted outright**.  Two Part I headlines (mine) were WRONG and are corrected: `tsx-01` is **not** "MCP-fallback duplicate orders" — reusing the same `client_order_id` is what makes Alpaca refuse the second submission, the harm is a live order misfiled as `rejected_by_broker`, and the MCP transport is unreachable in production (no UI creates an `alpaca-mcp` account; the host allowlist blocks it) so it is **P3**.  The oldest-500 fill cap (`perf-01`/`berel-02`) needs >500 fills per (account, source) — unconfirmed on the prod DB — so **P2**; settle it with `SELECT source, COUNT(*) FROM fill_events GROUP BY source`.

Five new lanes read what Part I skimmed and found P1s it missed: Coach `draft_order` coerces `short`/`cover` to **buy** (`src/lib/chat/tools.ts:92`); "Import from account" arms Autopilot on a live account with no guard (`app/console/guardrails/page.tsx:1021`); a draining account can be reactivated as the live trade target (`src/lib/db-api-keys.ts:1323`); price alerts stop evaluating when no account is active (`src/lib/alerts.ts:68`); unauthenticated `POST /api/chat-history` accepts forged turns.  Everything folds into **45 clusters** (22 tranche-1) with implementation plans.  Work from the clusters, not the finding count.  Also LIVE-21: the paired uptime flaps are origin stalls, not restarts (uptime continuous) — and prod being 2 merges behind main is correct (watch paths; those merges are iOS/docs only).

## 2026-08-19 CURSOR — iOS Home / Guardrails parity vs live web `a8a0a65b`

Hypothesis held: #2855/#2856 are on `main` (`a8a0a65b`).  TF **1.0.68** is behind that binary, so Guardrails → Universe → Indices still prints `sp500, nasdaqComposite, dow30, nyseComposite` on the phone.  Current `main` iOS already uses `DeskCopy.joinedIndexList` on Guardrails and Desk Current Policy — no leftover raw-slug join.  Remaining leaks on this tree: #2849 Desk subtitle still open, and Home / Guardrails / Insights still pointed at a nonexistent iOS **Strategy** page (web universe edits are on Guardrails).

This PR folds #2849 (`SectionHeading("Desk")` only) and retargets empty-universe copy at Guardrails with the same `S&P 500` example web uses.  Did not add iOS index checkboxes, Scan source chips, or Smart Money.  Did not merge / deploy / bounce / TF.  HOLD `5674dfaf`.  Did not touch #2841 / #2854 / #2840.

## 2026-08-19 CURSOR — Gather crumbs: no Pinecone inventory + 502/429 fail-open

#2852 is merged (`c7b775c5`) — keep the Robinhood ≤10 chunk.  Same Roth `9d71dda4` window also did thousands of Pinecone list/fetch, congress.trade 502, and Massive 429.  No OpenRouter strategy/completion call.  Only run-scoped audits: `usage_budget_status` at +10s, then the crash.  Robinhood `too many symbols (max 10, got 250)` at +18s remains the first hard fail.

Do not inventory the whole index during gather.  Do not flip `RAG_PINECONE_WRITE_CLASS`.  Do not prune.  Do not reopen #2840.  502/429 must not latch gather or skip Green.  New PR.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce.  Do not touch #2850 / #2849 / #2841.

## 2026-08-19 CURSOR — Robinhood max-10 quote chunk (rebased onto #2853)

#2853 is merged (`df1f5a37`).  This PR was CONFLICTING/DIRTY against that main.  Rebased `cursor/robinhood-quote-chunk-befc` onto `df1f5a37`.  The only real conflict was `docs/phase-7-strategy.md` (both added a 2026-08-19 stanza).  Kept #2853 drain/heartbeat/adopt and the ≤10 Robinhood chunk.  `strategy.ts` / quote-cascade did not conflict.

#2848 is live.  Roth `9d71dda4` wrote 00:58:57Z, llm=0, then `stalled_no_progress` at 01:29:44Z.  ASC: robinhood `too many symbols (max 10, got 250)` at 00:59:15Z (18s after start).  congress.trade HTTP 404 at 01:01:53Z.  One OpenRouter embed document.  Zero completion `llm_usage`.  account-miss 404 did not fire.

Root cause: `getEquityQuotes` sent the full scan universe in one MCP `get_equity_quotes`.  Robinhood rejected the batch, so gather never priced through Robinhood.  Do not shrink the universe to 10.  Chunk requests to 10.  congress.trade 404 is secondary and must not latch the free enrichment wave.  Do not reopen #2840 / #2853.  Do not touch #2850 / #2849 / #2841 / strategy picks.

## 2026-08-18 MONET — HOTFIX: `/console/connections` crashed client-side after #2848

Prod `c55c2e64` (live 00:51Z) renders "Dashboard error: process.uptime is not a function" on Connections.  `src/lib/db-execution.ts` module-scope `process.uptime()` reaches the browser bundle via `app/console/settings/brokers.tsx -> venue-contract -> source-settings -> db-api-keys -> db` (webpack stubs sqlite, not `process.uptime`).  Fix = lazy guarded accessor + regression test that fails on the old code.  Root cause (server DB modules in the client bundle; Turbopack `npm run dev` 500s every route after that page compiles) is a P1 in the MONET full-app review, not fixed here.

## 2026-08-18 CURSOR — #2848 verify hang + same-process stall labeled restart

verify-hosted: 7010 passed, 1 failed.  `test/alpaca-mcp.test.ts:214` timed out 60000ms — the 16s live first wait plus a never-settling first `getAccount` hung fake-timer advance.  Mock a short `alpacaAccountReadBudgetMs` in that test only.  Keep the live 16s wait and ROIC/FTS pause.

Same process `4abfb7fa` (`processStartedAt` 23:10:43Z, uptime ~34m) sweep-failed Roth `b3b83913` as "Process restarted mid-run".  That run started at 23:13:25Z on this process and sat llm=0.  Restart only when `started_at` predates boot; a same-process 30m stall is `stalled_no_progress`.  Do not merge.

## 2026-08-18 CURSOR — Manual Run once starved by ROIC / FTS on the event loop

#2847 is live (`4abfb7fa`).  The request lock is gone: Roth Manual Run once wrote `b3b83913` at 23:13:25Z.  That run sat ~17m with llm=0 and never reached Green.  Not a #2831 miss.  `roic-transcript-refresh` was already in-flight (23:11:45Z, RJF 2024Q2→2022Q4); 78 `ftsMirrorSlice` 6–13s; `getEquityQuotes` 6s ×28; alpaca-broker 6.5–7.4s.  Bounding the FTS tick is not enough if ROIC still owns the loop.

#2848 rebase onto `4abfb7fa`: keep 16s wait-above-p95 and FTS 2s / 1-row bound; **also** skip / pause ROIC and FTS while any `strategy_runs`/`strategy_run_requests` row is queued or running, and yield between ROIC periods.

Live unblocker for TF 1.0.68 is still seed-first `GET /api/scan` (names before Yahoo whole-set).  iOS `latestScan` kept for the next TF.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce / second TestFlight.  Do not touch #2848 / #2849 / #2841 / #2840.

## 2026-08-19 CURSOR — iOS Scan keeps last-good on a 503 refresh

Live `4abfb7fa` web `/console/scan`: Refresh scan once (not Run once) 503s, then paints the last-good universe from Aug 18, 2026, 7:25:13 PM (70 names / 5069 quotes / 5073 scanned).  Public `GET /api/scan` is 401.  TF 1.0.68 already has #2830 ScanView but iOS only called live `/api/scan` and replaced the table with the empty 503 body.  Snapshot had no `latestScan`.

Why Refresh 503s: after an empty Nasdaq screener, interactive `/api/scan` Yahoo-priced the whole ~5k allowed set inside the 35s budget.  That miss also dies as a generic 503 (often edge HTML, no `warnings` JSON) before the seed web already shows.  One bad row in `quotesBySymbol` also voided the whole seed.

Fix: seed before Yahoo whole-set; keep valid seed rows; compact `latestScan` on `/api/mobile/snapshot`; iOS paints that universe and keeps it on a failed refresh.  Did not merge.  Did not deploy.  Did not bounce.  Did not start a second TestFlight.  Did not click Manual Run.  Did not touch #2848 / #2849 / #2841 / #2840.

ASC follow-up (testers on TF **1.0.68** `202608182121` / `581467e1`, which already includes #2830+#2831): this is not a stale binary.  That client already calls `GET /api/scan` and decodes structured `scan_quotes_unavailable`.  Live Refresh still 503s without names (`4abfb7fa` scan path; live process is now `c55c2e64` = #2848 on top — scan/iOS files unchanged).  `/api/mobile/snapshot` on that live sha has no `latestScan`.  The 1.0.68 client times out at 25s vs the 35s server budget.  Do not start a second TestFlight.  Do not merge/deploy/bounce.  Do not touch #2848/#2849/#2841/#2840.  The 1.0.68-compatible fix is making `/api/scan` return names (seed before Yahoo) — already in #2850, not live.

## 2026-08-18 CURSOR — sweep-failed orphan leaves Manual Run once locked

#2845 is merged and live (`d4299bec`).  Do not amend it.  After that deploy, Manual Run once did not create a `strategy_run`.  ASC: 0 new Roth rows after 22:06:43Z.  Orphan `0e5ccd66` was stale-swept failed at 22:13:05Z (0 LLM) while `strategy_run_requests` stayed `status=running`.  That leftover request is the lock (`queueStrategyRunRequest` dedupes on `queued`/`running`; the worker never wrote the request terminal).  22:10:15Z `getPortfolioBundle` `8000+7000ms` is a separate slow first-read (#2848), not this lock.

Fix closes the matching open request on the sweep and `finishStrategyRun` write paths, heals already-terminal mismatches on the next tick, and heals this user's orphan on the next Manual Run once click.

Same class already fired before the swap (20:02Z, 20:15Z).  Console Run once preflights `accountReadiness`, which fail-closes on that dashboard 6s race.

Live `VECTOR_EMBED_BATCH_SIZE=32` POSTed 32 ingest texts to OpenRouter `baai/bge-m3`.  DeepInfra sums the whole `input[]` against 8192; a batch hit 8193 and 400'd `embed documents` from 19:12:49Z.  That is a batch-sum, not one unchunked 10-K.  #2812 stopped the 503; it did not embed those docs.  Hybrid producer still condenses first (`chunkDocument` 480 / `VECTOR_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS`); packing is a batch-window fix after that step.  `storeContexts` packs already-condensed texts under ~7500 `approxTokens` and embeds each group on its own lane so one over-limit singleton cannot skip the rest of a count-32 batch.  Local archive / store-more is unchanged.  No second filing chunker.  No extra table vectors.  Did not flip `RAG_PINECONE_WRITE_CLASS` or prune.  Did not re-clamp the #2800 fuse.  Infisical can keep the count at 32.  Did not drop rag-embed from health.

Sole conflict: `ios/SocraticTradeTests/UserFacingCopyTests.swift` — kept #2830 `testScanCopyDoesNotTreatWatchlistAsTheUniverse` and this PR's `testNotificationHistoryCopyStaysOrdinary`.  Silent auto-merge also duplicated `acknowledgeNotifications` in `MobileStore.swift`; dropped the extra copy.  History work unchanged: shared `notification_events`, website bell inbox, iOS Activity Notifications, last 100, ack via `POST /api/notifications/ack`.  Did not touch #2831/#2812/#2840, trading, broker, OpenRouter, RAG, or the health gate.  Not merging.  Not deploying.

`fetchNasdaqScreener` in `src/lib/market.ts` now uses the same `BROWSER_UA` + Origin/Referer + `fetchWithRetry` as nasdaq quote/calendar.  That is the 8s stub `"Mozilla/5.0"` abort that zeroed every scan since 2026-08-13T22:30Z (last good 513 quotes).  If Nasdaq still returns 0, Yahoo prices the whole allowed set so Scan ranks names again.  iOS `MobileStore` switch is exhaustive for `.scanQuotesUnavailable` (unsigned `xcodebuild` miss); Scan shows the abort warning, not silent No Candidates.  Rebased onto `origin/main` `7b073b65` (includes #2812 and #2832).  Did not revert #2812 / #2829 / #2800.  Does not block #2831.  UA/retry path not reverted.

## 2026-08-18 CURSOR — Green 400 must actually fail over (First Green after #2829)

#2829 is live (`6429d984`) and stopped the account-miss liar on 404.  It did not make Green complete.  Paper `PA33IDTHMFK9` run `7f5890a5-bc21-4474-87eb-9b595de04ed1` (19:33–19:38Z) picked `gpt-5.6-terra` → `openai/gpt-5.6-terra`, HTTP 400 "Provider returned error" (881ms), then claimed "Failover chain exhausted (3 Green Team endpoints)" after ONE stored `llm_call_latency`.  Red `deepseek-reasoner` never ran.  Roth had no `strategy_run` after process start 19:12:31Z.

Root cause: `isFailoverLlmStatus` left 400 out (404/403 only), and the exhausted sentence used planned seats, not stored calls.  Terra is on public `/models` but OpenRouter 400s it; fail-open still lets it win first pick.

Fix: 400 is failover-eligible (not a same-model retry, not an account miss).  Exhausted copy cites stored attempts only.  Terra is demoted from first Green pick when Gemini Flash / Mistral Medium class seats remain; those preferred seats lead implicit fallbacks.  Did not revert #2829 or #2800.  Did not rewrite the 400 sentence.

## 2026-08-18 CURSOR — Pinecone daily-fuse deadlock (rebased onto hybrid)

#2800 rebased onto `origin/main` (`cda485ff`, includes hybrid #2820 `ea68c1fc`).  Verified: the trip was local-MTD remainder math, not the 2.5M fuse and not a spent Standard trial.  Live card was used 0 of 15 estimated WUs, attempted 28, skipped 1.  Local month-to-date WUs (including pre-hybrid full-body writes) were treated as Pinecone's bill; leftover lifetime units collapsed the daily fuse below one document.  Hybrid processed writes stay; write-class stays full-body; prune stays dry-run.  Did not raise a post-trial 2.5M/60k ceiling.

## 2026-08-18 CURSOR — Today's Green 404s are valid public slugs, not tilde seats

Coolify receipts (sha `cda485ff`, SELECT-only, no raw OpenRouter JSON).  Mapper on that sha is still 404 → “isn't available on your OpenRouter account.”

Today's Green fails are **not** the missing-tilde seats.  Claude/Grok/Kimi/mini-latest were skipped (`skippedNoCredential`; that array also includes availability-filtered models) and never called.  Tilde restore will not by itself clear today's Green 404s.

Actual 404s, ~80ms, OpenRouter, `key_source=user`:
- 17:12:09Z Alpaca Paper `PA33IDTHMFK9` run `20072a55-2805-4d7a-8fa0-a1dff8c766cc`: pick `gemini-flash-latest` → called `google/gemini-3.7-flash` HTTP 404 86ms.  Failover chain exhausted (3 endpoints); only one `llm_call_latency`.  Red `gpt-5.6-luna` never called.
- 17:01:57Z Roth IRA `294709855` run `a9f29155-e139-4259-8666-25b0cf5f901c`: pick `mistral-medium-latest` → `mistralai/mistral-medium-3-5` HTTP 404 82ms.

Not 401/402/403/429.  Credits not involved.  Both slugs exist on public `/api/v1/models`.  7d 404s: `google/gemini-3.7-flash` ×2, `mistralai/mistral-medium-3-5` ×2, `mistralai/mistral-small-2603` ×1.  Fits #2771 `require_parameters=true` emptying the endpoint set.

PR **#2829** primary: omit `require_parameters` except the nano `max_completion_tokens` case; classifier must not use the account sentence for bare 404 / “No endpoints found”.  Secondary: restore `~` / dated public ids for skipped Claude/Grok/Kimi/mini-latest.  Keep `__rotate__`.  No dashboard adds.  No Stripe/IAP.

## 2026-08-18 CURSOR — IRA accounts must not tax-loss harvest

Owner screenshot: Autopilot sold NWG on the Roth with Green rationale "Harvesting unrealized loss… as part of tax loss harvesting strategy."  Roth/Traditional cannot deduct that loss.  Root cause: `taxContext` always included `harvestableLosses`, and Green was told it traded a taxable account whenever any tax block existed.

Fix: IRA prompt language forbids harvest; empty harvest candidates; omit harvest / LT-window fields on IRA runs; overlay account `taxationType` in strategy the same way the dashboard already did.  Prompt `agentic-strategy@2.12.0`.

## 2026-08-17 CURSOR — Pinecone daily-fuse deadlock (not a spent trial)

Owner correction after the 4:32–4:38pm CT cards.  Pinecone should still be writing.  The live
card was **used 0 of 15 estimated WUs, attempted 28, skipped 1** plus Siliconflow **0 or 1 of
1 texts** — a deadlock, not the 2.5M daily fuse and not the Standard trial wall.  Local
month-to-date WUs were treated as Pinecone's bill; remaining lifetime WUs collapsed the daily
fuse below one document, so used stayed 0.  "Expected ingest park" was agent slang for that
skip.  It was wrong.

HTTP 429 on a backup lane is not a success and not a reason to abandon the source.  Cboe is
serving ^VIX; Yahoo stays in the cascade for when Cboe dies.  Do not re-probe Yahoo while
Cboe is up (that is what burns the backup into 429s).

There is no OpenRouter files-endpoint prepaid-minimum outage.  ST `/api/health`
`openrouterCredits.ok` is true (threshold $3 only).  Owner has >$50 on OpenRouter.  CT
autopilot is still halted on a **stored** `error_class:billing` string — leftover, not a
live balance check.  Fix that in Congress.Trade; do not repeat the prepaid line.

## 2026-08-17 CURSOR — Pinecone trial is not the Starter 2M monthly wall

Owner: the app thinks monthly Pinecone write units are at the free-tier limit, and Pushover
is still firing for Litestream plus leftover health noise.  Live Pinecone is a Standard trial
(usage-billed ~$300 through 2026-08-30).  It does **not** have the Starter 2M WU / month cap.

A leftover `pinecone:wuExhaustedUntil` marker (or a 2M-shaped 429) parked every vector write
until the 1st of next month.  The gate runs before any upsert, so success could never clear
it.  A leftover `PINECONE_MONTHLY_WU_BUDGET=2000000` (or the post-trial 1.6M snap) also paged
the monthly pace guard.  Litestream L0–L3/L9 were already advancing; the remaining page was a

retired FilingAPI as `ok: false`.

Owner has ROIC access and not filingapi.dev.  Prod FilingAPI key is a dead 401; Plus checkout is refused (do not charge ST Stripe).  This branch removes live HTTP to filingapi.dev, the `filingapi` health lane, and cascade registration.  ROIC + SEC EDGAR 10-K/10-Q paths are unchanged.

## 2026-08-17 CURSOR — Green-Team empty/malformed failover + credits hint (#2577)

Aug 6: five Green Team runs died on OpenRouter `Empty response` across rotated models while the credits-low monitor flapped.  Green Team **is** the Bull proposer and already failed over on empty HTTP-200s when `llmFallbackModels` was set (#2313 / 2026-07-31).  Remaining gaps: malformed HTTP-200 JSON did not fail over; a rotating Green seat with no owner fallbacks was a single-model chain; `run_failed` never named a below-threshold OpenRouter balance.

## 2026-08-17 GROK — Effort-board hygiene

In Progress rebuilt to leftover real work. Verified-merged rows moved to Completed. Landing this mirror so GitHub effort issues close.

## Current (2026-08-17 GROK — strategy-run slugs + lease-lost mislabel)

Owner screenshot 8:34–8:38am CT.  Green Team failed on OpenRouter `mistralai/mistral-medium-3.5` (invalid; public slug is `mistral-medium-3-5`) and `gpt-5.4-nano` 400 Provider returned error (slug is correct; OpenAI endpoint is status -2 and does not advertise `max_completion_tokens`, Azure is healthy).  Pinecone + OpenRouter rerank "connection failed" at 13:34Z are `ProviderDispatchLeaseLostError` during the UptimeRobot 1m23s blip, not vendor outages.  Last-2d Pinecone Sentry otherwise is the known WU-fuse park.

## Current (2026-08-16 GROK — VECTOR_ASOF_STRICT on)

Owner: flip fail-closed dated retrieval.  Infisical ST prod `VECTOR_ASOF_STRICT=on` (was `off`).  Coolify restart `fwqascvivxvc7342hkw3aizk` finished; `https://socratictrade.com/api/health` is 200.  Live desk still omits `asOf`.  Branch `grok/asof-strict-on`.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-16-asof-strict-on.md`.

## Current (2026-08-16 GROK — ROIC Individual harvest)

Owner: get all we can from ROIC Individual (couple of weeks left) — breadth across the universe plus depth on names of most interest.  Expert panel already decided storage in `docs/designs/2026-08-16-proposer-corpus-storage.md` rev 3 (#2760).  No second panel.

This branch implements the transcript slice of that decision:

- Persist every fetched call into `earningscalls_transcripts` first (survives Individual expiry).
- Do not skip the ROIC walk when the Pinecone write fuse is spent.
- `latest` → one newest call for the demand-first universe.
- `deepen` → 20 quarters for held / watchlist / technical.
- `archive` → 20 quarters for everyone else, local cache only.
- Pinecone: extractive `earnings-summary` for latest/deepen; full-body only for the newest high-interest call (transcript exception until FTS exists).

#2750 `1867addd` single-flight is on `main`; Coolify deploy was in_progress at harvest start.  FilingAPI still owner Plus.

Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-16-roic-harvest.md`.

## Current (2026-08-16 GROK — 48h money-path + ingest)

Owner: explain rotation fail-open and 422s, then fix those plus Red timeout, and unstick SEC/ROIC/RAG ingest (Pinecone stay builder/free-ready).

- Rotation fail-open: when `/models/user` times out we still used the full catalog, including `kimi-latest` / `claude-fable-5` whose OpenRouter slugs 404.  Fail-open now drops those known-dead ids.
- 422: Alpaca HTTP reject.  Sub-penny limits on T (`24.865`) now round to `$0.01` at the Alpaca boundary.
- Red Team: same `llmFetchCapturing` + `strategyLlmTimeoutMs` path as Green (no 45s hard abort).  Adversary output cap 2500.
- Ingest: cherry-picked ROIC single-flight.  Requeue ~1k `embed_queued` dead letters that were misclassified budget-exceeded.  Budget skip defers 1h instead of dead-lettering.  Worker tick now claims at most 5 tasks across all jobs (prod had 521 running jobs claiming 5 each, so 2156 Aug-10 `facts_extracted` never ran).  Sibling #2748 owns the daily WU fuse park.

## Current (2026-08-16 GROK — ROIC single-flight + L2 shrink)

Owner: continue Litestream L2/L3, FilingAPI, and ROIC universe ingest until they actually work.

Branch `grok/roic-singleflight`, worktree `~/apps/trading-grok-ops-roic`.

#2741 is live (`4bd3bcc0` contains `b28a76ad`).  The new 6h due check wrote `lastAttemptAt` only at the end of a walk, so every 60s tick started another ROIC refresh.  Prod stacked 714 running `roic-transcript-refresh` rows and crashed about every 22 minutes (`last_restart_type=crash`).  Stopped the app, stamped `lastAttemptAt`, aborted the stacked journal rows, and restarted the existing image.  This PR single-flights the walk, stamps start immediately, persists the cursor after each symbol, and treats `lastAttempt` as a 30-minute in-flight window (a leftover cursor still resumes).

Litestream: L1 shrink keep-400 is in progress on B2 so the first L2 compact is small enough to finish.  L9 snapshots remain the restore floor.

FilingAPI: Infisical `FILINGAPI` is the same dead 32-char trial key (401).  Free signup is claimed.  Do not charge the owner's Stripe (that is ST's merchant account).  Owner Plus checkout on filingapi.dev is still required.

ROIC coverage before the pile-up: 46 transcripts across USB / OXY / SHEL (Individual 20-quarter depth).  After this lands the cursor can walk the rest of the universe without crashing the box.

## Current (2026-08-16 GROK — 48h prod error triage, Pinecone daily write fuse)

Pinecone trial is healthy ($238 of $300).  The "Usage limit hit" is the app's
rolling-24h write fuse at the trial cap of 2.5M estimated WUs, not a Pinecone
outage.  Retrieval still works.  Did not raise the cap.

Park incremental ingest when the fuse is spent.  Trial ingest stays full-steam
until ~$45 remains, then paces to the trial end.  On 2026-08-30 UTC snaps to
free-tier 60k WU/day.  ROIC/FMP/SEC now take the **latest** transcript and
latest 10-K/10-Q for the universe first, then extra history only for
held/watchlist/technical names.  Expert consensus: keep full bodies in SQLite
FTS + artifacts; do not LLM-summarize ingest; after trial put only extractive

## Current (2026-08-16 GROK — ARK official CSV fallback)

#2747 is live.  13F is complete in prod (413 rows, 12/12 filers, ISO

Cloudflare 403 and the throw skipped the working

Form 4 537 (340 with ticker), 13F 210 rows / 7 of 12 filers with

locked the retry.

Fixes on `grok/idea-sources-ops-fix` (worktree
`~/apps/trading-grok-idea-sources-ops`, issue #2735): parse `06-30-2026`

## Current (2026-08-15 GROK — stop ghost Gemini/DeepSeek keys)

Connections kept showing Gemini and DeepSeek keys after the owner removed them.  Cause: Infisical ST prod `/` still has `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; every Coolify boot ran `migrateLocalEnvCredentials`, which copied them onto `local` and treated a delete tombstone as empty.  Prod rows are labeled `migrated from env` (2026-07-24).

The last-48h failed Gemini/DeepSeek calls were **OpenRouter** (`llm_usage.provider=openrouter`), not native.  Strategy/Red Team prefer OpenRouter when that key exists.

Fix on `grok/stop-ghost-native-keys`, issue #2728 / PR #2729: never remigrate a tombstone; do not auto-seed Gemini/DeepSeek; tombstone existing `migrated from env` rows on boot.  Owner then had the Infisical source deleted: ST prod `/` no longer has `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.  `infisical-secrets-safe.sh set` refuses LLM runtime names.

Branch `grok/model-family-identity`, issue #2724.  Red stamps the catalog family on the verdict.

2. `9f7f870f` ATR-derived `secondaryBuy` pullback
3. `293d4bb5` server-knob Operations panel
4. `cb645a02` congress-stream level-based resume + honest effect copy
5. `40d5c087` strategist prompt data-age stamps

No schema bump in these five (main stays at 78).  Conflicts: `vector-db.ts` kept main's
`resolveSourceBool` and r4's `serverKnobBool`; `STRATEGY_PROMPT_VERSION` bumped to
`agentic-strategy@2.5.0` because main already used 2.4.0 for the venue-contract prompt.

Owner pickup of Monet's "iOS loading graphic and font..." session.  Product code
was already on `main` (#2667 `73dab29d`).  The dropped session's last step — a
computed-font check on live `socratictrade.com` — is now done: production login
at 375×812 computes `lato` on `body` and the Google sign-in button, eight `woff2`
files serve `font/woff2`, and `--font-sans` resolves through `--font-lato`.

Native splash / unflipped wordmark / iOS Lato are already on TestFlight
`1.0.13 (202608140722)` (`VALID`, `IN_BETA_TESTING`).  Last ship SHA `f9c89b9a`
contains #2667.  #2692 later added iOS quote-sheet work (different lane); the
splash / wordmark / Lato the owner asked for are already in 1.0.13, so no new
ship was cut for this pickup.  Production 503 Monet saw was the known SEC ingest stall, not this change;
site was 200 when this pickup started.

## Current (2026-08-14 GROK — Monet App / Issue Audit owner decisions)

Four Monet leftovers.  Implementable one done; the rest stay owner-only.

1. TestFlight invite — OWNER ONLY.  Not uniformly INVITED: John (`jo…comcast.net`) is INSTALLED on all four apps; Jay (`ma…jays.services`) is INSTALLED on Congress.Trade.  Other testers still INVITED.  Did not accept.
2. Litestream Coolify rolling + B2 write keys — OWNER ONLY.  Did not flip deploy strategy or mint B2 keys.
3. Congress.Trade trial — already 2 weeks in user-facing copy (#1835).  Offer verified 14 days (Infisical `STRIPE_TRIAL_DAYS`, ASC intro `TWO_WEEKS`).  Stale runbook fixed on `grok/ct-trial-copy`.
4. ASC listings — EULA only on Socratic Trade; betaAppReviewDetails names/notes empty on CT + both Usage apps.  Documented; did not write ASC.

Monet merge table all MERGED: #2680 #2681 #2682 #2684 #2685 #2687 #2709 #2712.

## Current (2026-08-13 GROK — quote Key Stats dashes + tappable fill/position cards)

Owner screenshot: GOOG iOS sheet showed $343.94 / +0.5% / volume / Alphabet, but P/E, EPS, yield, beta, 52W High/Low were all "—".  Footer proved the live chart fetch worked.

Root cause (not a cosmetic dash):
1. `fetchYahooFinanceQuote` already received `fiftyTwoWeekHigh=404.47` / `fiftyTwoWeekLow=197.46` on chart meta and **dropped them**.  `fastQuoteEnrichment` never mapped them.
2. PE/EPS/div/beta are not on the keyless chart.  They come from crumb-authed Yahoo quoteSummary inside the full cascade.  Wave A Yahoo can finish in 1–3s; the cascade then waits for paid/scarce providers; the 6s budget times out and discards the already-fetched fields.
3. `/api/quote` never read or wrote `symbol_field_latest`, so previously saved fundamentals stayed invisible and a successful open never updated the store.
4. v7 `/finance/quote` is HTTP 401 without a crumb — not a keyless floor.

Fix: map 52w on the chart floor; dedicated `enrichYahooFinanceSymbol` layer; durable seed + persist; entire iOS fill/position cards (and PWA position cards) open the same sheet.  n/a vs — convention kept.

## Current (2026-08-14 MONET — AGENTS.md records the "local gate does not compile Swift" trap)

Docs-only, branch `monet/agents-swift-gate-trap`.  The four-command verify gate
(`npm run lint` / `npx tsc --noEmit` / `npm test` / `npm run build`) and
`scripts/land.sh` compile **zero Swift**, so a fully green local run proves nothing
about `ios/**` — the first Swift compilation of any iOS change happens in CI.

This is recorded because it cost a real CI cycle on 2026-08-13.  Merging `main` into
`monet/apns-push` produced a duplicate `@Binding private var pendingDeepLink` and a
second `init(pendingDeepLink:)` in `MobileControlView.swift`, and **git did not flag a
conflict**: both sides had added the same declaration at slightly different offsets, so
the text merge kept both copies and reported success.  6,563 vitest tests and a clean
`next build` passed while the iOS app did not compile at all.  The compiler's third
error, `ambiguous use of 'Preview'`, named an innocent file — the `#Preview` block was
fine and singular, and only became ambiguous because there were suddenly two
initializers to choose between.

"Verify before claiming done" now carries a CAUTION block with the exact `xcodebuild
build` and `xcodebuild test` invocations to run whenever a change **or a merge** touches
`ios/**`.  A merge is the highest-risk case precisely because you did not write the code
and have no reason to suspect it.

## Current (2026-08-14 MONET — empty compaction level reads as a wedge)

Deep compaction has produced nothing since ~2026-08-08 and the per-tier backup
monitor called it healthy.  The terminal stage of a compaction wedge is not a
frozen level, it is an EMPTY one: litestream retention keeps pruning the wedged
level's pre-wedge objects while the wedge produces no replacements, so level 2
went 171 objects (2026-08-12, frozen) to 0 objects (2026-08-14, empty) — and
`fileCount <= 0` was classified `not-observable` / `no-activity-recorded` with
the detail "This is normal for a level Litestream has not needed to produce".
`/api/health` returned `litestreamDegradedReasons: []` for six days.

Production snapshot read 2026-08-14T03:46Z (`durable_state`, namespace
`litestream`): `status: "ok"`, `levelErrors: {}`, L1 fileCount 2032 / newest
03:46:05Z / txid `00000000000468d8`, **L2 fileCount 0**, **L3 fileCount 0**, L9
fileCount 2 / newest 00:00:06Z.  The listing SUCCEEDED — not a visibility
failure.

**PR #2709 MERGED** 2026-08-14T05:38Z as `a8f3ad86`; merge to `main`
auto-deploys to production.  Adds a third tier state `"empty"` carrying a verdict
(`wedged` / `upstream-wedged` / `expected`) and the feeder evidence behind it.
An empty level is graded against its IMMEDIATE feeder, and duration comes from
the feeder's file count via `CompactDB`'s one-file-per-interval-boundary
guarantee: `floor((K-1)/2) * interval`.  L2 today is
`floor(2031/2) x 30s = 8h27m` against a 2h threshold -> wedged; L3 ->
`upstream-wedged` with copy naming L2 as the fix.  Suppressed on a fresh
replica, an idle database, a superseded level, an all-empty prefix, and any
stale / failed / inconsistent listing.  New `checks.storage.litestreamTiersDegraded`
and `litestreamTierDegradedReasons`; `/api/health` `ok` deliberately does NOT
flip to 503.

Adversarial review round 2 found and fixed the one path that could silence the
new alarm: `supersededBy` scanned every higher level, including level 9.  Level 9
is a whole-DB snapshot (`CompactDB` shortcuts it to `db.Snapshot`), so its txid
tracks the live database rather than level 3 — and in the window right after each
daily snapshot that turned the L2 wedge into `expected/superseded degraded=false`
with a false "promoted rather than lost" sentence.  It now consults only levels
with a non-null `LITESTREAM_FEEDER_TIER`, pinned by a test on the production shape
plus a positive test proving `superseded` still fires where it is genuinely true.

**Blocker / next action is the OWNER's, not code:** the root cause is that every
Coolify rolling deploy briefly runs two litestream writers against the same B2
prefix; 0.5.12 has no fencing, colliding `MaxTXID` breaks `ltx.IsContiguous`, and
the level-1 -> level-2 promotion fails permanently.  Repair needs a deploy-strategy
change plus a one-time B2 delete.  This branch only makes it visible.

## Current (2026-08-13 ~3:45pm CT MONET — iOS ship pipeline repair)

Bot-merged PRs land on `main` and dispatch NOTHING — not CI, not ios-ship.  ST is
not exempt: PR #2675 (merged by `github-actions[bot]`, sha `ca38bb2979`) has 27
runs on that sha and zero are `event: push`, while #2680 (human-merged) gets the
full set.  Cause is GitHub's `GITHUB_TOKEN` recursion guard; `auto-merge-prs.yml`
claimed to prefer `GH_PAT`/`SHEPHERD_TOKEN` but neither secret exists, so the
fallback chain always resolved to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Fixed on branch `monet/ship-pipeline-fix` (worktree `~/apps/trading-monet-shipfix`):
auto-merge workflows + `merge-shepherd.sh` refuse to merge without an elevated
token (self-activating the moment the owner adds one); `ci.yml` gains an hourly
backstop cron with a fail-closed redundancy skip; `ios-ship.yml` drops the
undocumented 1h rate override (fleet standing gate is 2.5h — ASC upload gaps went
2.80h/2.58h before it, 1.60h/1.34h after) and gains `fetch-depth: 0`; a sha256 pin
(`scripts/ios-fleet.sha256` + `ios-fleet-pin.sh`) guards the untracked shared
tooling; `ios/project.yml` + pbxproj now record the actually-shipped 1.0.6 instead
of a stale 1.0.1.

Shared, UNVERSIONED tooling edits (live for all four fleet apps immediately;
backup at `/Users/jay/apps/ios-fleet/.backup-monet-20260813/`): `ensure-tf-ready`
now targets the build THIS run uploaded instead of "newest" (which is the previous
ship for the first minutes after upload), and renders the mandatory TestFlight
"What to Test" note.  Notes publishing is OPT-IN and defaults to a dry render —
owner sign-off needed before any tester sees auto-generated copy.

**Review round 2 (blockers fixed before landing).**  (1) The `*/30` cron had no
path gate and was already shipping backend-only commits — run `31723515355`
archived and shipped `39c6acee` (an alerts fix, zero files under `ios/`) to
testers.  `scripts/ios-scheduled-ship-gate.sh` + a 13-assertion offline test now
gate the scheduled path, and the test runs in CI on every PR.  (2) The
release-notes agent-name filter was start-anchored while the fleet writes tags at
the END — CT has 48 subjects with a non-leading `[AG]` and zero leading ones, so
`[AG]` would have published to TestFlight.  Markers are now stripped anywhere and
the deny-list gained a bracketed-`AG` backstop; verified zero leaks across 1500
subjects per repo.  (3) Version snapshot re-read at review time: 1.0.8 /
202608132022 (the train moved past 1.0.6 before the first commit was authored).

Gates (node 24): lint 0 errors / 764 warnings (grandfathered), `tsc --noEmit`

## Current (2026-08-13 ~3:50pm CT MONET — durable litestream remote-inventory cache)

PR #2665's per-tier backup monitor (`docs/rollouts/2026-08-12-backup-tier-monitor-real-coverage.md`)
never actually reported in production: `checks.storage.litestreamTierCoverage` stayed
`remoteInventoryState: "missing"` forever, forcing all 4 remote-only tiers permanently
`not-observable`. Root cause (re-confirmed via read-only `task_journal` evidence before
touching code): the collector scheduler lane genuinely worked (932 runs/24h, 0 errors), but
`getLitestreamRemoteInventory()`'s snapshot lived in a bare module-level variable, and Next's
build gives the scheduler and the API routes SEPARATE instantiations of
`src/lib/litestream-remote-inventory.ts` — the writer's assignment and the reader's lookup were
never the same variable. Fix: persist the snapshot through the existing
`src/lib/db-durable-state.ts` `durable_state` primitive (no migration needed). `lastAttemptAtMs`
(the 30-min collection gate) deliberately stays in-memory — reasoning + evidence in the rollout
note and in a code comment at the call site. Two new tests use `vi.resetModules()` + fresh
`await import(...)` to force genuinely separate module instances and prove the fix; both
confirmed to fail against the pre-fix source. Full local gate green: tsc clean, 566/567 test

## Current (2026-08-13 MONET — litestream compaction visibility: make a silent backup failure loud)

Step 3 of a diagnosed fix (Steps 1/2 — disabling Coolify rolling replacement, a one-time B2
delete of poison L1 objects — are the owner's, not implemented here). Background: level-2 deep
compaction has been frozen in production since 2026-08-08T14:35Z (two concurrent `litestream
replicate` processes per Coolify rolling deploy emit L1 objects with identical MaxTXID,
permanently failing `ltx.IsContiguous`) and ran silently for five days — `/api/health` stayed
`ok: true`, `litestreamDegradedReasons: []`, the whole time.  Branch
`monet/compaction-visibility`, worktree `~/apps/trading-monet-compaction`.

Three additive signals, one correction: (1) `litestream.coolify.yml` gains `validation: interval:
1h` — **at the TOP LEVEL, not nested under `dbs:`** as the originating task brief said; verified
against the pinned v0.5.12 Go source that `Validation` is a field on the top-level `Config`
struct, not `DBConfig` — nesting it would have silently done nothing.  Deliberately did NOT add
`verify-compaction: true` (would re-list the ~90k-object L1 backlog after every compaction — the
same request/socket-churn class that wedged deploys via tcp_mem exhaustion on 2026-07-10).  (2) A
third, independent detection signal that needs no S3/B2 credentials and does not depend on the
remote-inventory pipeline (which has a separate known bug in flight on `monet/durable-inventory-cache`
— not touched here): litestream owns the container's real stdout via `-exec`, so
`scripts/coolify-prod-start.sh`'s single `run_app litestream replicate ...` line now tees its
combined output to `$DATA_DIR/litestream-runtime.log` (`> >(tee -a ...) 2>&1` — process
substitution, not a `| tee` pipe, so `$!`/SIGTERM-forwarding/exit-code propagation are unchanged;
verified via a full local dry-run with fake litestream/next binaries before landing).
`src/lib/runtime-health.ts` gains `scanLitestreamRuntimeLogFile` (bounded 256 KiB tail read,
never throws) scanning for litestream's own `compaction failed`/`validation error detected`
lines; wired into `/api/health` as `checks.storage.litestreamCompactionLogFailureCount` (count
only — raw lines never hit the public body) and `alertStorageWarning`.  (3) No new
`NotificationEventType`/migration: reuses `alertStorageWarning`'s existing free-text
`warningType` exactly like the 7 other storage alerts already do, so this is unaffected by
whichever order it lands relative to `monet/real-toggles` (#2682, open at time of writing,
removing that function's force-include pattern).  Currently INERT in production — the
`.litestream-disabled` kill-switch marker (dropped today for an unrelated OOM incident) short-
circuits before the new tee line.

Zero-code finding: searched `docs/rollouts/*.md` + `STATUS.md` for claims the L2 wedge was
"cleared"/"fixed" by the two earlier `rm -rf .app.db-litestream/ltx` resets — found none; every
existing entry already correctly says the resets never touched B2 (confirmed against litestream's
`DB.ResetLocalState` source: local-only, no B2 call).  No doc corrections were needed.

14 new tests (11 unit in `test/runtime-health.test.ts`, 3 integration in
`test/connection-health-routing.test.ts`), verified to fail without the implementation (`git
stash` the 4 non-test files, re-run, 14 failed/50 passed, `git stash pop`).  Gates (all green):
tsc clean; lint 764 problems/0 errors (grandfathered backlog, no new warnings on touched lines);
full `npm test` 566 files/6581 tests passed, 51 skipped; `npm run build` exit 0, 40/40 static
pages.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-13-litestream-compaction-visibility.md`.
## Current (2026-08-13 ~3:20pm CT MONET - HONEST SERVER STATS: fabricated CI runners deleted)

`/admin/server` was showing six GitHub Actions runners that do not exist -- `socratic-ci`,
`socratic-ci-2`, `congress-ci`, `shared-ci`, `usage-ci` (all tagged `ci-cpx32`, a box deleted
2026-07-31) and `github-runner` -- every one pinned to `running:healthy`.  They were hardcoded
string literals at two sites in `app/api/admin/server-metrics/route.ts`, returned on five
paths including a successful-but-empty live list.  No GitHub token exists in ST prod, so
production served them on 100% of requests.  Real truth: ST has ONE runner,
`mac-xcode26-socratic`.

Replaced with a discriminated result (`state: known | unavailable` + machine `reason` + human
`detail`), modelled on `assessLitestreamTierFreshness`.  Also fixed: `"unhealthy".includes("healthy")`
painting every unhealthy container green, the status label truncating the health half off, the
hardcoded "litestream is replicating to R2" claim in the Security card, and four host cards
that were blank with no stated reason.  `AGENTS.md` note blaming "stale Coolify-side
registration" corrected -- it was our own code.

Adversarial review then caught the same class of bug reintroduced one card over: the Services
card rendered an empty `resources` array as "coolify reported no services for this server" even
when Coolify was never configured or the read failed -- and the failed-read case renders on an
otherwise fresh-looking page, because the Hetzner reads succeeding keeps the stale-cache
branches from firing.  Fixed with a matching `resourcesObservation: known | unavailable+reason`
and a three-state Services panel.  Two smaller honesty fixes rode along: the Security card no
longer claims live provider reads on the local path, and the CPU meter now states that its
per-core scaling is unverified.

Owner action: supply `GH_TOKEN` to ST prod Infisical if the runners card should show live data

## Current (2026-08-13 MONET — real toggles: banned force-include notification pattern removed)

Owner ruling 2026-08-12: "ALL toggles must be real" — no force-included notification events,
ever. Ten call sites across eight files (`lookahead-audit.ts`, `signal-health.ts`,
`db-health.ts` x3, `scheduler.ts`, `earningscalls-transcripts.ts`, `usage-limit-alerts.ts`,
`broker-health.ts`, `strategy.ts` x3) injected a specific event type into that send's effective
`enabledEvents` regardless of the user's stored setting, silently overriding an OFF toggle
forever. All removed; every site now passes the real `policy` through unmodified.

Replaced with a one-time versioned migration (`src/lib/db.ts`, version 78,
`notification_enabled_events_backfill`): backfills the eight previously-force-included event
types into any LEGACY stored `enabledEvents` array that predates them (only touches rows with an
explicit array already present; a row with no `notificationSettings` key at all already defaults
to every current type via `mergePolicy`). After the backfill the Settings toggle is genuinely the
user's — on by default, off if/when they turn it off, and it STAYS off. (Originally landed as
version 77; `monet/apns-push` (#2681) merged first and claimed 77 for `device_push_tokens` —
renumbered to 78 and rebased, see the rollout note's "collision with #2681" section.)

Rewrote one existing test (`test/guard-enablement.test.ts`) that explicitly pinned the OLD
force-include behavior as a "regression" test; added new regression coverage proving
`signal_health` and `lookahead_leak` are NOT delivered when switched off
(`test/signal-health.test.ts`, `test/lookahead-audit.test.ts`), plus a dedicated migration test
(`test/db-migration-notification-backfill.test.ts`). Bumped 12 hardcoded schema-version
assertions in `test/persistence-hardening.test.ts` from 76 to 78 (77 is now `device_push_tokens`
from #2681).

Infisical prod now: TTL `24`, `VECTOR_EMBED_CLEAN_TEXT=on`, `RAG_MULTIQUERY=on`, `RAG_HYDE=on`,
`RAG_EMBED_DISCLOSURES=on`.  Worker already on; max-per-run stays 25.  Left off: FMP transcript
rights, full 8-K body, `VECTOR_ASOF_STRICT`.

Code (branch `grok/rag-advanced-enable`, worktree `~/apps/trading-grok-rag-enable`): catalog
default 24h; Settings user overrides now actually drive clean-text / multi-query / HyDE.
Reindex `POST /api/admin/reembed` after the queued main deploy picks up Infisical.  Do not
purge rev-1 until that run completes with zero failures.

## Current (2026-08-13 ANTIGRAVITY — Dashboard Parallelization and Litestream Generic Disable)

**Branch `ag/rebase-2646` (Dashboard Refactor & Litestream Kill Switch):**
1. **Litestream Crash Loop Fix**: Added a generic `LITESTREAM_DISABLE_MARKER` to `scripts/coolify-prod-start.sh` to allow manual disabling of Litestream during memory leak incidents. 
2. **Dashboard Performance**: Refactored `getDashboardSnapshot` in `src/lib/dashboard.ts` to parallelize `getAccounts` and `getPortfolio` fetches when the account number is known, significantly reducing dashboard load times.
3. **Verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` clean, `npm test` clean, `npm run build` clean.
4. **Ops**: The `.litestream-disabled` marker was dropped on the prod server's data volume to disable the crash-loop immediately on the next start. B2 generation wiping is pending owner coordination.

## Current (2026-08-12 ~9:20pm CT MONET - console false load-failure, phone-correct load graphic, iOS candlestick splash, Lato everywhere)

Owner-reported four-parter, all landed on `monet/loading-fonts`.  The headline is a real bug: the
console showed "Couldn't load the autonomy desk" on essentially every load while the iOS app on the
same account loaded fine.  Both clients call the SAME `getDashboardSnapshot`, so this was never a
server split - the console's 15s first-load watchdog SET `error`, and the shell rendered its
full-screen failure card on `error` alone, so any first load in the routine 15-24s band (the
server's own sequential broker-chain worst case) showed a failure screen while the request was
still in flight and about to succeed.  iOS has no such timer and simply waited.  Fixed via a new
pure `console-load-state.ts` ("an error while a fetch is still in flight is not a failure") with the
15s timer demoted to a reassurance line under the load screen; 7 regression tests - the rule was
untestable inside the React hook (node-only vitest, no jsdom), which is why it shipped.  Server-side
slowness itself is UNTOUCHED and remains the real follow-up: parallelising the sequential
accounts -> portfolio/positions/orders -> quotes chain.

Also: the intro canvas now measures the fixed overlay instead of `window.innerHeight` (they
disagree by 60-90px on iOS Safari, which pushed the chart down and clipped its low wicks on every
iPhone), DPR 3 on phones, iOS URL-bar resize absorption, safe-area-aware landing box.  iOS
`LaunchStateView` (icon + spinner + "Socratic.Trade") is now the candlestick SOCRATIC TRADE wordmark
at the top that slides away, sized by the web `MobileBrandRow` formula, plus a `LaunchBackground`
colorset that kills the white cold-launch flash.  Found and fixed a shipped bug along the way:
`CandleWordmarkView` rendered the wordmark VERTICALLY MIRRORED (S as 2, R as K, A as Y) from a
double row-flip in `alphaAt` - visible on the login screen in the current build.  Lato is now
self-hosted (deliberately NOT `next/font/google`: a build-time fetch would freeze auto-deploy) as
the site-wide default plus a named picker option, and bundled on iOS with Dynamic-Type-preserving
`.app*` twins across all 120 call sites.  Worth knowing: `--font-sans` named "Inter" but never
loaded it anywhere - no @font-face, no next/font, nothing in public/ - so the site had been
rendering in the device system font all along; Lato is the first real webfont it has ever resolved.

Gates: tsc clean, lint 0 errors, 6449 tests green, build clean, xcodebuild 40 iOS tests green.
Verified live, not just green: iOS simulator screenshots of the real launch sequence (that is how
the mirrored wordmark was caught), the built .app bundle inspected for font placement, and the
console load screen at 375x812 with Lato confirmed resolving at runtime.

`scoreHeadlineRelevance` rubric (`news-relevance.ts`, incl. the ambiguous-company-name
corroboration gate), keeps up to 3 currently-active company-relevant markets per symbol

fails open to no-data on any error.  Wired into `strategy.ts`'s `proposeTrades` at the same seam
`prompt-headlines.ts` and `getUpcomingEconomicEventsForPrompt` use — prompt-time only (candidates

degrades to honest 'unverifiable') with asOf pinned + strictAsOf, diffing chunk ids against the

post-asOf chunk a hard mismatch.  value/quality/volatility/sentiment/positioning/diversification

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET - APNs native push, MERGED end to end + contract reconciled)

**2026-08-13 update - merged `origin/main` `39c6acee` into the branch.**  Five conflicts, all
resolved deliberately: `device_push_tokens` moved from migration **75 to 77** (main landed 75
`lookahead_audit_findings` + 76 `fundamental_revisions`; two `CREATE TABLE`s under one version
number would be unreachable for any DB that already ran the other), 12 schema-version assertions
in `test/persistence-hardening.test.ts` retargeted, `project.pbxproj` **regenerated with xcodegen**
from the merged `project.yml` (verified it still substitutes `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` /
`$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`), and `MobileControlView.apply(_:)` **taken from main in full**.  That
last one was a real bug, not formatting: this branch's older `apply()` predates deep-link proposal
focus and silently discarded `destination.proposalId`, so every `pending_approval` push - which
`pushDeepLink()` emits as `/console/approvals?proposal=<id>` and the parser correctly turns into
`.proposal(id:)` - would have opened the Proposals list with nothing highlighted.  It would have
compiled and passed every test.  Also corrected: the rollout note's claim that no AASA file exists
is stale - #2662 landed `app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association/route.ts` and its
`middleware.ts` `PUBLIC_PREFIXES` entry, so universal links and push taps now share one parser.
`.gitignore` gained `*.p8` (an APNs auth key is team-wide; a loose `.p8` in the repo root was
untracked but not ignored).

Branch `monet/apns-push` (worktree `~/apps/trading-monet-apns`), forked from `origin/main`
`5784c1cf`.  Merges the two parallel halves - `monet/apns-server` (`c4bd3acb`) and
`monet/apns-ios` (`f697bd32`) - with **zero conflicts** (disjoint by construction; even
`project.pbxproj` merged clean, so no xcodegen regen or objectVersion re-patch was needed) and
makes the contract between them real.

- **Server half:** push is a NEW DELIVERY CHANNEL in the EXISTING notification system - one more
  `NotifyChannelId` in `src/lib/notify.ts`'s `CHANNELS`, same `sendNotification` -> `notify` path,
  same `enabledEvents` gate.  Migration 75 `device_push_tokens` (token is PRIMARY KEY, registration
  REASSIGNS on conflict so a shared phone switching accounts cannot leak the previous user's
  alerts; `environment` stored, never inferred).  `src/lib/apns.ts` uses `node:http2` (fetch cannot
  speak HTTP/2 to APNs), caches the ES256 provider JWT at 50 min, retires tokens on 410 / 400
  BadDeviceToken, surfaces 403 loudly.  `POST`/`DELETE /api/mobile/push/register`, session-authed.
- **iOS half:** `aps-environment: production` in BOTH `SocraticTrade.entitlements` and
  `project.yml`; the environment is read out of `embedded.mobileprovision` at runtime, never
  `#if DEBUG` (TestFlight IS production - guessing sandbox is a silent 400 forever).  Permission on
  first Proposals visit; taps route through the same `DeepLink` parser as `onOpenURL`; sign-out
  withdraws the token BEFORE cookies are cleared.
- **Contract fixes made in the merge** (the point of this phase): the catch-all deep link was
  `/console`, which the iOS router REJECTS (it needs `/console/<screen>`) - so 17 of the 24 event
  types tapped to nowhere, silently.  Now `/console/activity`, which routes and is where the
  notification is actually listed.  Also dropped `pushLinkOrigin`'s `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN`
  fallback: the app pins the host to exactly `socratictrade.com`, so an unrelated env var could
  have turned every tap into a no-op.  The register body, environment literals, auth, payload key,
  and sign-out DELETE all lined up already and were left alone.
- **Pinned by a cross-language contract test:** one table row per `NotificationEventType` in
  `ios/SocraticTradeTests/PushNotificationTests.swift`; Swift asserts each URL routes to the stated
  tab, and `test/apns-deep-link-contract.test.ts` parses those rows and asserts `pushDeepLink()`
  emits exactly them - set-equal to `NOTIFICATION_EVENT_TYPES`, so a NEW event type fails the test
  until the app names it.  Mutation-checked (reverting the catch-all fails 2 of 11).

Verified (foreground): `xcodebuild ... test` -> `** TEST SUCCEEDED **`, **Executed 73 tests, 0
failures** (70 before); `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0; **full** `npx vitest run` -> 554 files passed /
1 skipped, **6419 tests passed** / 51 skipped; `npm run build` exit 0; `npm run lint` 0 errors.
End-to-end delivery is STILL unverified - it needs a TestFlight build on a real device plus the
deployed server.  Post-deploy: confirm all four `APNS_*` values exist in ST prod Infisical, or
Settings -> Delivery shows "iPhone push - not configured" and sends nothing (by design).
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-12-apns-push.md` (replaces the two per-branch notes).
## Current (2026-08-12 MONET - backup tier monitor: real coverage, previous version had none)

Branch `monet/backup-tier-monitor-real` (worktree `~/apps/trading-monet-tierfix`).

`assessLitestreamTierFreshness()` shipped 2026-08-11/12 claiming per-compaction-level backup
freshness for levels 0/1/2/3/9.  Verified on the live container today: it reported
`state: "unknown"` for ALL FIVE tiers on every health check - zero coverage, while presenting
itself as a five-tier breakdown.  Two independent causes:

1. It read local `<statePath>/ltx/<level>/`, but litestream 0.5.12 keeps ONLY level 0 on disk
   (`/app/data/.app.db-litestream/ltx/` has exactly one entry, `0`).  Levels 1/2/3/9 exist only
   in the B2 replica and could never be observed that way.
2. `ltx/0` holds 1,078 files; the shared scan returned `null` past a 256-entry bound, so even
   level 0 - the one readable level - degraded to "unknown".

The level-2 wedge it was built for was running the whole time (`compaction failed ...
non-contiguous transaction ids`; levels 1/2/3 frozen since 2026-08-08/10 while level 0 advanced).

Fixed by grading each level from a source that is actually valid: level 0 from local LTX in real
time, levels 1/2/3/9 from a new scheduled 30-minute remote replica inventory
(`src/lib/litestream-remote-inventory.ts`; `litestream ltx -level N -json`, never inline - the
`-level all` form measures 143s/14.1MB).  Anything else now reports an explicit
`state: "not-observable"` with a reason instead of a bare "unknown".  Degradation requires a
level to be past threshold AND behind level 0's txid, so an idle database cannot false-alarm.

Gates: tsc clean, lint 0 errors, `npm test` 6383 passed / 51 skipped (551 files), build passes.
Does NOT clear the underlying wedged level-2 compaction - still open ops work.

## Current (2026-08-12 CLAUDE - connection-health alert noise, root-caused)

Branch `claude/health-alert-noise` (worktree `/private/tmp/fx-st-health`).  Sentry carried ~28
distinct `"<name> connection failed"` issues, almost none of which were real outages.  Seven
verified causes fixed together, kept individually reviewable in the diff:

1. **Streak gate** - the alert gated on `lane.stoppedWorking`, which is ALSO set by two soft
   heuristics that a low-frequency lane's FIRST failure satisfies.  Now requires the hard
   `HEALTH_REASON_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` streak.
2. **Fingerprints** - pinned to stable lane ids so display-name drift stops fragmenting one lane
   into six issues.
3. **429 asymmetry** - RAG 429s now skip Sentry the way db-health always did; `alertUsageLimitHit`
   escalation intact.
4. **Re-probe loop** - all synthetic probe failures log soft, breaking alert -> 6h cooldown ->
   re-probe forever.
5. **Retired vendors** - FMP / Quiver / UW excluded from the alert path.
6. **Timeouts** - usage-monitor budget + knobs reads 2500ms -> 8000ms and soft-logged (both are
   fail-open).
7. **Local-fault mislabel** - `storeContexts` receipt/finalize SQLite faults attributed via a new
   cause-chain-walking `localDbFaultReason` instead of "RAG vector store failed".

congress.trade 502s (SOCRATIC-TRADE-B/8/1P) and the filingapi 401 (SOCRATIC-TRADE-1G) confirmed

## Current (2026-08-12 CLAUDE — CI scripts: Sentry `app` tag + branchless fingerprint, effort-sync transport retry)

Two python-only CI-support fixes on branch `claude/ci-report-app-tag`
(worktree `/private/tmp/fx-st-ci`):

1. `scripts/sentry-ci-report.py` had no app identifier, so ST's events in the
   SHARED `fleet-infra` Sentry project deduped into Congress.Trade's
   identically-named workflow issues ("CI", "Security", "Effort Issues Sync").
   Adds `APP = "socratic-trade"` to the message, tags, and fingerprint.
   Fingerprint is now `[ci-failure, app, workflow]` — branch is a tag only,
   because merge-queue refs are unique per attempt and were minting a throwaway
   Sentry issue per queued run.
2. `scripts/sync-effort-issues.py` `http_request` caught only `HTTPError`, so
   today's `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` reaching api.github.com killed the
   whole run.  Adds bounded exponential-backoff transport retry for idempotent
   methods only — a `POST` is never replayed, since a truncated create response
   means the issue already exists and a retry would duplicate it.

Crons `monitor_slug` deliberately left un-namespaced: renaming orphans live
Sentry monitors, and there is no collision to fix.  Gates and a 15-check
behavioral harness recorded in the rollout note.

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET — iOS parity wave 3: cancel a working order from the phone)

Branch `monet/ios-order-cancel` (worktree `~/apps/trading-monet-wave3`).  Integration branch:
merges `monet/ios-parity-wave2` and `monet/order-cancel-server` (both clean, no conflicts) and
adds the iOS half of roadmap item #3 on top.

- Open orders were the phone's last see-but-cannot-act money surface.  `OrderRow` on the Assets
  screen now carries a **Cancel Order** button plus swipe-to-cancel, both opening the same
  confirmation dialog — the same ceremony the alert-delete row already uses.  No typed
  confirmation: the server requires none for cancel even on a live brokerage account, because
  cancelling prevents an execution rather than causing one.
- The control appears only on WORKING orders.  `OrderCancellation.isWorkingState` mirrors the
  server's `isWorkingOrderState` exactly (`ACTIVE_BROKER_ORDER_STATES` +
  `EXTRA_WORKING_ORDER_STATES`), so it matches the precondition `cancelWorkingOrder` enforces.
  `done_for_day` is excluded (terminal, but returned forever in Alpaca history); `pending_cancel`
  stays cancellable, matching the console — a stuck broker cancel is a reason to ask again.
- Payload `{ orderId, accountNumber }` where the account number is
  `readiness.selectedAccountNumber` — the server's stale-view guard, so a cancel queued while
  looking at one account cannot land on another.  Submitted through the normal `store.submit`
  path (busy guard + per-order idempotency key + snapshot reload); gated on the wave-2 control
  catalog so an older server hides the control instead of collecting a 400.

Round-2 review close-out (all three reviewer items closed; rollout §7):

- **The queued-loosening gap is CLOSED server-side.**  `policy.patch` now accepts an OPTIONAL
  `expectedCurrent` precondition — the same shape as `order.cancel`'s `expectedAccountNumber` —
  carrying the values the client believed were current for the fields it is patching.  Validated
  at queue time (scalar patchable fields only; unknown/wrong-typed/non-object is a 400) and
  compared at EXECUTION time before anything merges: a mismatch audits
  `mobile_policy_patch_precondition_mismatch` and throws `PolicyPatchPreconditionError` (409), so
  the whole patch is refused rather than partially or silently applied.  Without it, a tightening
  tapped against a $10,000 cap could execute as a LOOSENING minutes later, behind a draining
  `strategy.run_once`, if the console lowered that cap meanwhile.  A patch with NO
  `expectedCurrent` behaves exactly as before (proven by a test that performs the same mid-flight
  edit and asserts the legacy write still lands) — the web console is unaffected.  The iOS
  tightening UI now sends the precondition, so the "These controls only tighten" footer is true
  end to end.
- **Cancel is exempt from the >180 s snapshot-staleness gate**, like `account.activate`: a flaky
  connection is exactly when someone reaches for cancel, and the server re-validates
  (`requireWorkingOrder: true` -> 404/409), so a stale tap gets an honest error, never a wrong
  cancel.  Still requires a loaded snapshot and still respects the control catalog.
- **The deep-link focus ring is transient again** — it clears on any tab change and expires four
  seconds after the link lands, instead of marking one proposal card out for the whole session.

Verified: iOS 68/68 XCTests (56 merged base, +8 cancel, +2 round-1, +2 here), `npx tsc --noEmit`
clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors, full `npx vitest run` 6369 passed / 51 skipped (552 files).

Next: owner action only — TestFlight shipping.  Follow-ups: render the server's `dustWarning`
on the card after a cancel; replace-at-market from the phone.

Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-12-ios-parity-wave3.md`.

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET — iOS parity wave 2: guardrail tightening, control catalog, universal links)

Branch `monet/ios-parity-wave2` (worktree `~/apps/trading-monet-wave2`).  Three items, all on
server capabilities that already exist:

1. **Tighten Guardrails** in the account/settings sheet — submits the existing `policy.patch`
   mobile command.  Autopilot -> Ask-First, and 75/50/25% reductions of `maxOrderNotional` /
   `maxDailyNotional`.  Tighten-only is a pure predicate (`PolicyTightening`), and it refuses
   entirely when a competing percent-of-NAV cap is stored, because the server's
   `normalizeExclusivePolicyCaps` would delete that cap and change which rule binds.  No new
   confirmation ceremony: same weight as Close Only / Wind Down.
2. **`snapshot.catalog` decoded** (`mobileControlCatalog()`), gating non-protective commands
   through `MobileStore.serverAdvertises`.  Missing catalog or empty `commands` falls back to
   the app's built-in controls; protective halts are never catalog-gated.
3. **Universal links + deep-link routing** — the app's first `onOpenURL`.
   `https://socratictrade.com/console/{approvals,approvals/<id>,orders,watchlist,activity}`
   routes to the matching tab (reusing the existing More-stack rerouting for unpinned tabs);
   `socratictrade://` stays auth-callback-only.  Entitlement + `project.yml` claim
   `applinks:socratictrade.com`; the domain half is `app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association/
   route.ts`, added to middleware `PUBLIC_PREFIXES` so Apple's anonymous fetch is not redirected
   to /login.

Verified: iOS 56/56 XCTests (was 37), `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, new vitest file green,
`npm run build` clean (AASA prerendered static).

Next: owner action — no App Store Connect / Apple credential work was performed; the associated
domain only takes effect once a build carrying the entitlement ships.

Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-12-ios-parity-wave2.md`.
## Current (2026-08-12 MONET — mobile `order.cancel` command, server side)

Roadmap item #3, server half.  The phone could see working orders (`/api/mobile/snapshot` already
filters by `isWorkingOrderState`) but could not kill one.  Now it can.

- The console's cancel logic was extracted out of `app/api/orders/cancel/route.ts` into
  `src/lib/order-cancel.ts` (`cancelWorkingOrder`), so mobile runs the SAME path — lease-interleave
  receipt, time-bounded cancel-dust advisory, `order_cancel` audit, dashboard event, dust
  notification — instead of a second implementation drifting against the gateway.  The route is now
  the HTTP shell; console behaviour is unchanged and its three existing route tests pass untouched.
- New mobile command `order.cancel`, payload `{ orderId, accountNumber? }`.  Immediate (bypasses the
  sequential worker, so it cannot land behind a 30-minute `strategy.run_once`) but deliberately NOT
  protective — it must not cancel the operator's other queued work the way stop/close_only do.
- No typed confirmation: cancelling closes risk, it does not open it.
- Account isolation: every cancel is scoped to the requesting user's own selected account through
  their own credentials; a caller-named account that is not the selected one is refused before any
  broker I/O (`order_cancel_account_mismatch`), and the mobile lane additionally resolves the order

Owner Assets screenshot + follow-up.  Four bugs on one branch
`grok/ios-watchlist-chip-wrap` (worktree `~/apps/trading-grok-watchlist-chips`):

1. Watchlist chips wrap mid-ticker — content-sized `WrappingHStack` (#2657).
2. Use-account looks dead, then snaps — keep Switching pill until snapshot.
3. Tradier Sandbox `$0` P&L — unrealized from positions; realized "—" without fills.
4. Admin Portal stuck — loading UI, cookie timeout, same-host subframe allow.
5. Alpaca Paper "won't switch" — activate now invalidates the dashboard snapshot cache.

## Current (2026-08-12 ~7:30am CT CLAUDE — external-repo lessons round 2: alpha grading, signal health, cancel-dust)

Round 2 of the owner's external-repo lessons request (broad sweep: TradingAgents, ai-hedge-fund,
freqtrade, qlib, RD-Agent, FinMem).  Three definitive wins land in this PR, each built by a
dedicated agent, adversarially verified, and integration-fixed:

1. **Opt-in benchmark-alpha outcome grading** (`policy.outcomeGradingMode`, default raw,
   byte-identical): alpha mode grades decisions against SPY over the same window, cites alpha in
   the post-mortem prompt, writes divergence receipts (raw won / alpha lost = beta-not-skill),
   and keeps an :alpha stat ledger in retrieval-usefulness weighting.
2. **Live signal-health monitor**: daily lane computing rank IC of the LLM's own confidence vs
   matured outcomes (90-day window), quantile buckets, top-K churn, gross-vs-net; edge-triggered
   drift alarms via notify(); optional auto-throttle knob (default OFF); Signal Health card on
   Results (migration 74 — first migration shipping under the new BEGIN IMMEDIATE boot path).
3. **Cancel-dust advisory** (advisory ONLY, never blocks): partial-fill cancels that would
   strand a below-broker-minimum fragment warn in the cancel sheet + audit; pre-fetch is
   time-bounded so the emergency cancel lever can never wait on a hung broker read.

Gates: tsc clean, targeted suites 82/82; full lint/test/build via land.sh at push.  Rollout:

## Current (2026-08-12 ~6:40am CT CLAUDE — HOTFIX: boot migrations vs rolling deploys)

PR #2652's auto-deploy failed (deployment pyqxv16i): the incoming container crash-looped on
SQLITE_BUSY loading the instrumentation hook and Coolify rolled back (prod stayed up on the old
build).  Root cause: runMigrations used better-sqlite3's default DEFERRED transaction — under a
rolling deploy the outgoing container commits continuously, and the WAL snapshot upgrade throws
an instant SQLITE_BUSY that busy_timeout does not cover.  Fix: apply migrations via BEGIN
IMMEDIATE (apply.immediate()) so the 60s busy_timeout works; new child-process contention
regression test.  This PR's own deploy applying migration 72 is the live proof.  Blockers: none.

## Current (2026-08-12 ~6:20am CT CLAUDE — symbol drawer everywhere + iOS fills redesign)

Owner requests: ticker/logo clicks open the Market Scan company drawer on every surface
("all aspects of the site anywhere really"), and the iOS Activity fill cards get bolder/larger
text + a denser layout (screenshot critique).  Branch `claude/ui-symbol-drawer-fills`.

Web: closed every remaining un-wired symbol render (order cancel/replace sheets, live-approve
sheets, decisions rows via a stretched-link restructure, admin data-catalog + rag-coverage with
SymbolDrawerProvider newly mounted in the admin layout).  Fixed a real crash the sweep exposed:
SymbolDrilldownSheet's unconditional useConsoleData() throw outside the console shell — new
useConsoleDataOptional(), with an honest "not available here" exposure state.  Mobile PWA
deferred honestly (drawer depends on con-* tokens the PWA does not load).

iOS: FillActivityRow/CommandActivityRow typography bumped (ticker title3 bold, notional title3
semibold, date footnote) with tighter AppCard padding; new SymbolInfoSheet (same /api/quote
cascade as the web drawer) tappable from fills, positions, orders, watchlist, flow chips,
alerts, and proposals; 44pt remove target restored; derived marketCap removed (no fabrication).

Verified: tsc/lint/targeted vitest green; xcodebuild green (incl. post-merge with #2647 tabs +
parity wave); browser check — AAPL click opens the "AAPL details" con-drawer with live data;
admin routes 200.  Rollout: docs/rollouts/2026-08-12-ui-symbol-drawer-fills.md.  Blockers: none.

## Current (2026-08-12 ~5:40am CT CLAUDE — dsa-lessons round 1: digest, relevance, receipts)

Owner asked for lessons from ZhuLinsen/daily_stock_analysis (62k-star LLM stock-analysis repo),
then broadened to a moderately broad GitHub sweep.  Research ran as two 15-agent workflows
(readers -> synthesis -> per-lesson gap analysts); full verdicts + sketches in
`docs/reviews/2026-08-12-dsa-lessons-gap-analysis.md`.  This lane (branch `agent/claude`) lands
round 1 — three implemented lessons, each built + adversarially verified + integration-fixed:

1. **Opt-in daily watchlist digest** (default OFF; Settings -> Delivery): typed report context
   (latest persisted scan quote + proposal trajectory per symbol) -> full/medium/brief renderers ->
   notify() `bodyTiers` picking the largest tier per channel via new `CHANNEL_CAPABILITIES`
   (also retires the latent pushover/ntfy truncation gap).  New `trade_proposals.symbol` column
   + index (migration + backfill).  Fires once per CT day at/after 15:15 CT via a watermark lane.
2. **News entity-relevance gating** (default ON, real off-switch via `NEWS_RELEVANCE_*` knobs):
   AV `relevance_score` and Marketaux `match_score` were documented-but-discarded — now parsed and
   gated (match_score normalized /100 — it was ~12-82, making the 0-1 knob inert until the
   integration fix); leaf rubric `news-relevance.ts` with ambiguous-company-name corroboration;
   stream path drops only zero-evidence associations on multi-symbol articles.
3. **Proposal repair-ladder receipts** (money-path, surgical): `TradeProposal.dataAdjustments`
   kind-prefixed receipts; deterministic session-vs-phrasing guard (never blocks/rewrites);
   `confidenceCapDataDegraded` tuning knob; existing bracket-fallback disclosures now also write
   receipts; approval card renders them.

Gates: lint 0 errors; tsc clean; targeted suites 76/76; full test+build via land.sh at push.
Next: round-2 implementation (benchmark-alpha grading, signal-health monitor, cancel-dust
advisory) on this lane after merge; UI lane (`claude/ui-symbol-drawer-fills`) lands separately.
Blockers: none.

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET — iOS parity wave 1: decision-critical fields, protective controls, swipe actions, admin portal)

**Branch `monet/ios-parity-wave1`** (stacked on `monet/ios-customizable-tabs`, PR #2647): First
wave of the iOS parity roadmap — all zero-backend, rendering already-decoded snapshot data and
dispatching existing command types.  (1) Proposal cards now show price drift (reference → current
price with signed %), last revalidation time, and the Red Team failure kind when the verdict is
unavailable (console `describeRedTeamFailureKind` wording).  (2) Home gains Close Only + Wind Down
protective controls beside Stop (`strategy.close_only` / `strategy.liquidating`, same
CommandButton/store.submit pattern, no added ceremony).  (3) `policy.runDuringExtendedHours` is now
decoded and a pure `deriveRunStateWord` mirrors the console's `deriveStateInfo` vocabulary — the
app can no longer say "Running" while the console says "Paused · market closed" (7 new XCTests).
(4) Swipe-to-reject on proposal cards (reject ONLY, never approve) and swipe-to-delete on alert
rows via a new ScrollView-compatible `swipeRevealAction`; watchlist swipe skipped (chip grid, not
rows — one-tap remove already exists).  (5) Triggered alerts show `triggeredAt`/`triggeredPrice`.
(6) Account sheet rows show capabilities + draining state.  (7) New `AdminPortalView` (admin-only
row) hosts /admin in a navigation-fenced WKWebView with native-session cookie handoff.  28/28
tests pass.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-12-ios-parity-wave1.md`.

## Current (2026-08-12 MONET — iOS customizable tab bar + xcodegen version-regression root cause)

**Branch `monet/ios-customizable-tabs`:** The iOS app's tab bar is now owner-customizable with
the exact web mobile-tabs semantics (`app/console/lib/mobile-tabs.ts` parity: pin/unpin, min 2 /
max 4, canonical-order bar, always-present More surface keeping every screen reachable), using
the native system `TabView` so the Liquid Glass appearance is preserved.  Programmatic tab jumps
to unpinned screens reroute into the More stack.  8 new XCTests pin the contract.  Along the
way, found and killed the ROOT CAUSE of the 2026-08-11 version regression: `xcodegen generate`
was rewriting Info.plist's version keys to literal `1.0`/`1` because `project.yml` never
declared them — now declared as `$(MARKETING_VERSION)`/`$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` so any
future regen preserves substitution.  A parallel expert-panel workflow is reviewing web↔iOS
parity and reports separately.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-12-ios-customizable-tabs.md`.

## Current (2026-08-11 MONET — litestream per-tier backup status: health check + admin panel)

**Branch `monet/backup-status-panel` (committed locally, not pushed — see rollout note for why).**
Tonight's litestream incident (stuck level-1 B2 compaction anchor, silently wedged 27+ hours —
see the escalation trail above and `docs/rollouts/2026-08-09-event-loop-stall-instrumentation.md`)
exposed a real gap: `checks.storage.litestream*` on `/api/health` only ever observes level 0
(continuous sync) via the IPC socket, so it would NOT have caught this. Added: (1)
`assessLitestreamTierFreshness()` in `src/lib/runtime-health.ts` — per-compaction-level (0/1/9)
freshness via local `ltx/<level>/` file mtimes, with documented thresholds (10min/4h/30h) and a
graceful "unknown" state everywhere litestream isn't configured this way; (2) wired additively
into `checks.storage.litestreamTiers` on `/api/health` (existing fields untouched) + folds into
`storageDegraded` + per-tier `alertStorageWarning`; (3) new admin panel `app/admin/backups/` (nav
entry "Backup Status") showing Continuous Sync / Compaction / Daily Snapshot per-tier health,
backed by new admin route `app/api/admin/backup-status/route.ts`; (4) tests in
`test/runtime-health.test.ts` (unit), `test/connection-health-routing.test.ts` (integration,
reproduces the exact incident shape against the real route), `test/backup-status-route.test.ts`
(new, admin route). `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors, targeted vitest run (57
tests across the 4 touched/related files) green. Full `npm test`/`npm run build` run before
commit — see the rollout note for final counts. Does NOT fix the underlying stuck B2 anchor
itself (that's separate ops work, still open). Rollout:

   - Refactored `mobile-pwa-client.tsx` into modular components under `app/mobile/components/` (`MobileHeader.tsx`, `MobileNavBar.tsx`, `MobileHomeTab.tsx`, `MobileProposalsTab.tsx`).
   - Implemented `usePreventScrollChaining` hook for WebKit boundary top check (`scrollTop === 0` set to `1`) and CSS `overscroll-behavior-y: contain` to prevent iOS Safari body scroll chaining.
3. **Verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` clean (0 errors), `npm test` (83 files / 739 tests passed), `npm run build` clean.

## Current (2026-08-12 ~12:20am CT MONET — new app icon: dollar-sign candlesticks)

Owner supplied a reference image (3D-rendered candlesticks arranged as a "$", green/pink
palette, light gray grid background) and asked for it as the app icon with a lightened
background. Replaced `ios/SocraticTrade/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon-1024.png`
(previously a "ST" wordmark built from candlesticks) with a processed version of the owner's
image: background lightened via a saturation-based blend (candlestick colors untouched, smooth
ramp rather than a hard threshold to avoid speckling in the soft-shadow areas), resized to the
required 1024x1024, confirmed opaque RGB (no alpha — required for App Store icons). Single-file
change, no other icon sizes to update (this appiconset uses Xcode's unified single-size format).
## Current (2026-08-12 ~12:08am CT MONET — litestream reset executed; leak appears resolved, monitoring continues)

Escalation trigger from the previous entry fired (kill gap compressed to 5m35s). Owner approved
proceeding. Executed the previously-planned fix: `docker stop` (clean, 30s), cleared the local
litestream LTX metadata directly on the host volume path (`litestream reset`'s documented effect
— never touches the DB file or B2), Coolify `start` (image reused, no rebuild). ~6 min outage.
Post-restart: litestream started with zero errors (previously every fresh start hit a checksum
mismatch within 2-3 min, without exception), memory at 374MiB ~4 min in (previous fresh starts
were multi-GB by this point). Strong early signal, NOT yet confirmed as fixed — several hours of
clean operation spanning a level-9 snapshot cycle is the real bar. Full detail + what to check if
it recurs: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-09-event-loop-stall-instrumentation.md` ("Fix executed" section,
bottom).

## Current (2026-08-11 MONET — iOS version regression fix)

PR #2637 accidentally hardcoded `ios/SocraticTrade/Info.plist`'s `CFBundleShortVersionString`
to the literal `"1.0"` and `CFBundleVersion` to `"1"`, replacing what used to be
`$(MARKETING_VERSION)`/`$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` build-variable substitution. This silently
broke the owner's version regimen (App Store "Version" goes 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2 per release,
separate from the internal build number): bumping `MARKETING_VERSION` in the Xcode project would
no longer have actually changed what ships. Restored both fields to variable-substitution form
and set `MARKETING_VERSION`=1.0.1 / `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`=2 in both `project.pbxproj`
(Debug+Release) and `project.yml` — this is the first build after 1.0.0/1.0 already shipped to
TestFlight. `preferredProjectObjectVersion`/`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` from #2637 left untouched
(legitimate fixes, not part of this regression). Rollout:

## Current (2026-08-11 ANTIGRAVITY — System Audit & iOS Resiliency Rollout)

Artifact `implementation_plan.md` created; review note `[ST, Antigravity] Comprehensive System Audit & Improvements` created and pinned in Apple Notes (folder `Coding`). Native iOS client updated with exponential backoff retry loop (`MobileAPIClient.swift`) and raw JSON disk caching (`MobileStore.swift`) for instant `<50ms` offline startup. All gates verified green (Xcode build, tsc, lint, vitest). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-11-system-audit-and-ios-resiliency.md`.

## Current (2026-08-11 ~9:40am CT MONET — litestream kill cadence ACCELERATING: 51→78→49→20→19 min gaps)

Since the root-cause deploy below, 6 more OOM kills logged (all `exitCode=137`, all auto-recovered
in ~1s, site health unaffected each time). The gap between kills has compressed from ~50-80 min
down to ~19-20 min over the last 3 cycles — consistent with the confirmed root cause (the stuck B2
compaction anchor persists in the replica's own state across restarts, so un-compacted WAL keeps
growing across the whole incident, not per-container). **Escalation trigger set:** if the gap
compresses under ~10 minutes, stop deferring to "daylight" and actively clear the stuck B2
generation now (see next steps in the rollout note) regardless of local time. Full timeline +
reasoning: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-09-event-loop-stall-instrumentation.md` (escalation section,
bottom).

## Current (2026-08-11 ~4:30am CT MONET — litestream leak root cause CONFIRMED, not yet fixed)

The all-night litestream OOM-leak (open since 2026-08-09) has a confirmed root cause now, not
just a hypothesis: litestream's B2 replica is stuck compacting from txid `2324d` — every retry's
multipart upload fails with `file checksum mismatch` on close (~every 100s), the anchor never
advances, so each retry re-uploads a larger accumulated range, which is why memory climbs and why
peak-per-kill severity keeps growing (2.05→4.82GB across 9 kills so far). No existing kill-switch
applies (the only one is R2-specific and explicitly no-ops on B2). Site serving health remains
unaffected throughout (Docker `restart: unless-stopped` recovers every crash in seconds) — this
is not an outage, but the leak itself remains open. Full evidence + next steps for daylight fix:

## Current (2026-08-11 MONET — server-metrics panel repair + canonical Oracle→Hetzner doc correction)

**No branch (config + docs, direct on `main` — repo-side changes on `monet/*`, see below):**
ST's admin server-stats panel was fully broken (`degraded: true, stale: true`, Coolify 401 +
Hetzner 404×2) because `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` — and therefore this session's own initial
answer to the owner — had never caught up with the 2026-08-07 emergency cutover off Oracle Cloud
(Oracle suspended the account without reason, `docs/rollouts/2026-08-06-ios-login-522-oracle-down.md`)
to a brand-new Hetzner box (`docs/rollouts/2026-08-07-hetzner-fleet-cutover.md`). Three stale
values found and corrected: `HETZNER_SERVER_ID` (wrong box) and `COOLIFY_SERVER_UUID` (wrong
UUID) in ST's Infisical, plus a dead 401 `COOLIFY_SERVER_STATS` token in BOTH ST's Infisical and
the `~/.secrets/global-api-keys.env` handoff file (fixed from the box's own dedicated, working,
read-only-scoped token at `/root/.coolify-api-token-stats` — deliberately did NOT substitute the
broader `COOLIFY_AGENTS` token, preserving the read-only/admin scope separation). Panel verified
fully live post-fix: `degraded: false, stale: false, cacheAgeSeconds: 0`, real resources
(`socratic-app`, `congress-trade`, `usage-monitor`). `AGENTS.md`'s hosting section rewritten to
lead with the real current host: `167.233.254.55` / `fleet-hetzner-nbg1` / Hetzner `cx43` (8 vCPU
AMD EPYC-Rome, 16 GB RAM, 160 GB NVMe) / Coolify server UUID `jxzqcs3h6g1wiipnnblhismp` / Hetzner
hardware serial `159792099`. UM's own panel not independently re-verified (no admin credential
available this session) — UM's hardcoded fallback defaults already match the correct live

**Branch `monet/sec-worker-edgar-403`:** minutes after the trial knobs + full-universe seed went
live, every SEC ingest worker fetch 403'd (`www.sec.gov/Archives`), dead-lettering ~50 tasks.
Root causes: worker fetched with NO User-Agent (SEC hard-403s undeclared tools; the refresh lane
passes UA explicitly and kept working), prod lacked `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT` (now set in Infisical),
secLimiter only reacted to 429 (SEC signals blocks with 403), and the worker burned stage attempts
into an IP-level block. Fixes: UA auto-injection for `.sec.gov` in `politeFetch`; `report403()`
global cooldown (`SEC_403_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`, default 600s) + `pausedUntilIso()`; worker defers
(attempt refunded, `edgar_403_deferred`) instead of failing; `requeueSecIngestDeadLetters` + admin

**Branch `monet/sec-shard-field-fix`:** the trial knob set from the throughput audit is now
APPLIED in prod (Infisical + Coolify restart; all 7 values verified in the serving process env):
delay 0ms, batch 32, texts/day 250k, WU/day 2.5M, SEC per-run 200, TTL 6h, ingest worker ON.
`data/rag-universe-manifest.json` copied onto the prod data volume (the `/app/data` volume mount
shadows the image's `data/`, so the seeder 500'd ENOENT). First full-universe seed then exposed a
real bug: `SubmissionsJson.filings.files[]` used invented field names `filingStart/filingEnd`;
real EDGAR shards carry `filingFrom/filingTo`, so the shard-pagination sort threw
`undefined.localeCompare` and aborted the seed (test fixture had the same wrong names — suite
green, prod broken). Fixed with real names + `?? ""` guard. Re-seed after this deploys. Rollout:
`docs/rollouts/2026-08-09-trial-knobs-applied-and-edgar-shard-fix.md`. Next: re-run seed, watch

hourly-429 mess. (A) Throughput audit — every ingest limiter inventoried with TRIAL vs AFTER values
for the owner to apply in Infisical (no secrets read/written). Headline: `VECTOR_EMBED_BATCH_DELAY_MS`
(default 21s, a Voyage-3-RPM artifact) is applied unconditionally between embed batches and pins
ingest at ~1,371 chunks/h even on OpenRouter bge-m3 — the single biggest lever. OpenRouter embed
spend is NOT the constraint (~$0.0013 per 1k chunks); post-trial Pinecone STORAGE is. (B) New
`src/lib/pinecone-monthly-pace.ts` — persisted calendar-month WU counter (fed from
`meterPineconeUpsert`, resets on month roll), linear month-end projection with a 0.2 elapsed floor
(mirrors `r2-usage.ts`), `PINECONE_MONTHLY_WU_BUDGET` default 0 = OFF. When projected pace exceeds
the budget the SEC ingest **backfill queue** stops claiming new tasks; incremental filing ingest and
all retrieval are structurally un-gated. ONE advisory + audit per calendar month. Number exposed at

## Current (2026-08-09 MONET — "Pinecone connection failed / database is locked" mislabel)

**Branch `monet/pinecone-lock-mislabel` (commit-only; landing operator lands):** the hourly
owner-visible push titled "Pinecone connection failed" with body `inventory fetch: database is
locked` was OUR SQLite, not Pinecone. Root cause: `settleProviderDispatch`
(`src/lib/db-provider-dispatch.ts`) opened a DEFERRED transaction that SELECTs before it UPDATEs,
so promoting the WAL read snapshot to a write returns `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT` ("database is
locked") instantly WITHOUT consulting `busy_timeout` — which is why the 60s ceiling never absorbed
it; every ledger transaction now opens `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (repro receipts in the rollout note).
Second fix: new `src/lib/local-db-fault.ts` classifies local-SQLite failure signatures, and
`withRagApiHealth` no longer writes a provider failure row or a `provider_degraded` push for them —
it records a `local_db_contention` audit row and, past 5 occurrences in 6h, ONE advisory titled
"Storage Warning: local database contention" (never a vendor name); `alertConnectionFailure` gets
the same guard for non-RAG lanes. Real Pinecone HTTP/network errors behave exactly as before.
Gates: tsc clean; 22 test files / 236 tests green (new `test/local-db-fault-classification.test.ts`
7/7, both new assertions verified to fail without the fix); lint 0 errors. Rollout:

## Current (2026-08-09 MONET — durable embed stage: embed-once guarantee)

**Branch `monet/embed-stage` (stacked on `monet/pinecone-wu-breaker` / PR #2596; commit-only —
landing operator lands):** owner directive — a paid OpenRouter document embedding must never be
paid for twice. New SQLite `embed_stage` table (durable L2 under the process-local L1 cache):
`storeContextsImpl` persists each paid vector (Float32 BLOB, keyed
content_hash-of-embed-input + model + embed-rev) AFTER provider validation and BEFORE the
Pinecone upsert; upsert success deletes the rows (managed commits defer to after
markCommitted); upsert failure keeps them and every retry path replays them with ZERO provider
calls — durable across restarts. WU-breaker gate still blocks everything (incl. stage-consume)
until it lifts; stage replays on resume. Retention: 35d orphan sweep + 2 GiB oldest-first cap in
the daily audit-prune lane. Receipts: `embed_stage_replay` audit (embeds avoided per store call),
`embedsFromStage` on results + lastIngest. Gates: tsc clean; 33 test files / 376 tests green

ONE storage_warning + audit, health row soft `[expected-limit]`), early gate in
`storeContexts`/`storeDocument` refuses writes BEFORE any embed spend
(`wuExhausted` typed skip, ≤1 audit/day), sec_ingest tasks park cleanly via new
`deferSecIngestTask` (retry_wait at marker expiry, stage attempt refunded — no retry storm
or dead-letter), sec-filings bulk loop stops at the first gated filing. Auto-clears on

**MONET (this seat; posts earlier today were tagged CLAUDE before the owner re-ruled the seat) ran the owner-requested full-product review** (live signed-in prod session +
12-agent workflow): findings in `docs/reviews/2026-08-06-claude-full-product-review.md`,
handoff in `docs/rollouts/2026-08-06-claude-full-product-review.md`, issues labeled
`product-review-2026-08-06`. Highest-urgency discoveries:

- **Deploy freeze (P0): all five 2026-08-06 deploys failed** — Coolify's SSH exec stream
  dies mid-build (exit 255, "disconnected by user"), correlated with CT OCR load on the
  shared box; prod sat on `6b47a886` while main advanced 4 merges. Zombie helper
  `onlrw5mgf4s2pw9he4udt2kg` (13.5h) removed; webhook redelivered; retry on a quiet box
  progressed past every earlier failure point (see rollout note for final status).
- **Litestream→R2 was PAUSED (P0)** since Aug 4 (free-tier kill-switch). **Superseded
  2026-08-07 GROK:** active replica → **Backblaze B2** (see Current header); R2 left
  historic. Cross-app R2 free-tier noise may still alert but must not stop B2 backups.
- **Results page shows +56.47% vs SPY on a flat account (P1)** — phantom inferred
  $36.5k withdrawal + SPY series silently 0.00% everywhere; and the tax open-lots ledger
  contradicts live positions (T long 91 sh vs actual short −1.881). Overlaps GROK's
  `grok/fix-account-return-pct`.
- **Two unmanaged shorts (P1)**: PG/T shorts sit unprotected because every enforcement
  layer skips shorts while `shortSellingEnabled` is off (`app/console/lib/derive.ts`).
- **Shared-package drift (P1)**: manifest pins `congress-trading-shared#v2.5.1`, lockfile
  ships 2.5.0 — the filingDate member-skill dependency is not actually deployed.

## 2026-08-05 GROK — multi-period TWR

## 2026-07-06 — Learned-context copy fix + browse/delete archive (CLAUDE, `agent/claude`)
Owner flagged awkward empty-state copy on the Learned Context approval queue and asked why the AI
doesn't auto-learn and let the user review/delete afterward. Answer: it mostly already does — the
`fact` tier is silent passthrough, never queued; only `risk`/`strategy-directive` (numeric limits,
sizing, leverage, authority) confirms first, and that's deliberate (ingested-document/inference
safety, not paternalism — see `docs/chat-multiuser-learning-design.md`). What was genuinely
missing: the "browse + delete what was silently learned" surface the design doc promised but never
built. Shipped both: reworded the empty-state copy; added `deleteLearnedContext` (ownership-scoped,
also the shared-contribution erasure path) in `src/lib/db-learning.ts`, new `GET
/api/learned-context` + `DELETE /api/learned-context/[id]` routes, client helpers, and a new
collapsed-by-default `LearnedFactsArchive` browse/delete component in
`app/console/approvals/learned-context.tsx` wired into the approvals page. New
`test/learned-context-delete.test.ts` (7 tests: ownership isolation, foreign-user 404, shared-row
erasure, audit trail, superseded-row exclusion). 8-angle adversarial review found no
correctness/security bugs (two correctness-adjacent candidates investigated and refuted with
concrete evidence — see rollout note). Branch had drifted far behind `origin/main`
(Coolify/Hetzner migration, mobile fixes, RAG/sizing/prompt-safety work); merged by hand after
reviewing every flagged overlap, re-verified full quartet on the merged tree: tsc clean, lint 0
errors, 283 files / 2843 tests green, build clean. **Merged as PR #998** (`1c0c20d3`).
**Deployed to production** 2026-07-06 21:30:29Z via `~/apps/trading-publish.sh` — verified

## Where things stand

**2026-08-04 — Multi-Source Quote Cascade & Staleness Resolution (ANTIGRAVITY).** Implemented a 5-level redundant quote cascade resolving active broker gateway → Alpaca snapshots → Yahoo batch → Yahoo single → ROIC.ai profile. Converted the quote staleness policy check into a non-blocking gate that mutates opening orders to limit orders to defend the price (buy capped at min(limit, ref), short capped at max(limit, ref)), appends warning text to rationale, writes a `quote_staleness_warn` audit trail, and alerts the user via `provider_degraded` push. Full tests and builds check out clean. Rollouts: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-multi-source-quote-cascade.md`, `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-non-blocking-quote-staleness-gate.md`.
**2026-08-04 — Multi-Source Quote Cascade & Staleness Resolution (ANTIGRAVITY).** Added a redundant multi-source quote cascade in `src/lib/quotes-cascade.ts` checking broker quotes, Alpaca snapshots, Yahoo batch, and Yahoo single quote APIs in series. Integrated it across the strategy run loop, proposal approvals, and chat draft promotion. Added a unit test suite to verify the cascade level routing. Full type check and lints pass. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-multi-source-quote-cascade.md`.

**2026-08-04 — EOD Quote History Cache SQLite Migration (ANTIGRAVITY).** Migrated the legacy flat-file JSON EOD quote caching (`data/history-5y/`, etc.) in `src/lib/history.ts` to a fully SQLite-backed table `history_cache_eod` to resolve test failures and ensure robust silent-caching. Replaced `fetchLocalFlatFileHistory` with `fetchHistoryCacheEod`. Updated the `test/history.test.ts` suite to seed the SQLite DB directly. Full tests pass. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-04-history-cache-eod-migration.md`.

**2026-08-03 — Subdomain Host Routing & EOD Quote Caching Upgrade (ANTIGRAVITY, branch `agent/antigravity`).** Added `mobile.socratictrade.com` $\rightarrow$ `/mobile` and `console.socratictrade.com` $\rightarrow$ `/console` host-level routing in `middleware.ts`. Upgraded EOD price history in `src/lib/history.ts`: added `isBarSeriesFresh` staleness detection, `mergeOHLCBars` merging for stale flat files, auto-persistence of fresh provider bars into SQLite `imported_price_eod` and disk, and `eod_cache_stale` audit logging. All gates green (`tsc`, `lint`, vitest 27/27, Next.js `build`). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-eod-quote-caching-and-subdomain-routing.md`.

**2026-08-03 — iOS/mobile account switch hangs (MONET, branch `monet/ios-account-switch-fix`).**
Owner screenshots: Roth IRA spinner stuck, Sandbox still Active, Home stale + 2 queued · 1
running. Root cause: `account.activate` waited on the global sequential mobile worker behind
`strategy.run_once`, and clients also blocked switch when the snapshot was stale. Fix: run
`account.activate` immediately (same path as stop), allow switch on stale snapshot (iOS + PWA),
clear iOS busy spinner from the terminal POST before snapshot reload. Focused mobile tests
16/16; full gates via land.sh. Rollout:
`docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-ios-account-switch-immediate.md`.
**2026-08-03 — Console RAG Evidence Card Deduplication (ANTIGRAVITY, branch `agent/antigravity/mobile-pwa-feedback`).** Fixed duplicate RAG evidence rendering (`sec-edgar` and `Retrieved 10 K` cards showing identical document receipt & score) in proposal drawer by deduplicating RAG attributions against `decision.evidence` in `deriveEvidenceRows` (`app/console/page.tsx`). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-dedupe-evidence-cards.md`.

**2026-08-03 — Console dashboard `topCandidates.slice` white-screen (GROK, branch
`agent/grok-fix-dashboard-topcandidates`).** Owner report: main `/console` showed
`Dashboard error` / `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'r.topCandidates.slice')`.
Root cause: `deriveEvidenceRows` assumed every truthy `latestScan` had array
`topCandidates`. Fix: `safeTopCandidates` + snapshot normalization in `dashboard.ts`.
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-console-topcandidates-slice-crash.md`.

**2026-08-03 — Xcode App Settings & Apple Sign-In Layout Constraint Fix (ANTIGRAVITY).** Configured Xcode App Category (`public.app-category.finance`), Display Name (`Socratic.Trade`), Marketing Version (`1.0.0`), and Build Version (`1`) across `Info.plist` and `project.pbxproj`. Fixed `ASAuthorizationAppleIDButton` layout constraint collision warning (`width == 392` vs `width <= 375`) in `LoginView.swift` by capping `SignInWithAppleButton` width to 375pt. `xcodebuild` succeeded clean. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-03-xcode-app-settings-and-apple-signin-constraint-fix.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Exit-0 outage root-caused + exit-code hardening (MONET, branch
`monet/exit0-outage-audit`).** The 15:29Z "clean exit 0, stayed down" outage was an
**unpaired docker-API stop**, with the 0 fabricated by a pid-1 signal-re-raise bug in the
infisical wrappers plus in-container npm swallowing SIGTERM (sandbox-reproduced in the
real image; every deploy had been hard-killing next-server). Fixed: wrappers exit 128+N,
boot script now supervises the app (spontaneous clean exit → 40, every exit logged,
`node_modules/.bin/next start` direct — npm banned from the exec chain), new
production-gated `src/lib/exit-guard.ts` re-tags spontaneous in-app exit(0) → 43 with
call-site receipts. Restart policy is already `unless-stopped` — evaluated, **no flip**
(it restarts any spontaneous exit; the outage class is API stops, now covered by rule +
honest codes). `docker events` forensics verified broken (~256-event ring ≈ minutes on
this box) — journalctl is the durable source. Contract + traps codified in AGENTS.md
("Production exit-code contract"). Rollout:
`docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-exit0-outage-audit.md`. Next prod stop/deploy should log
`app exited with code 143 after forwarded SIGTERM` as live confirmation.

**2026-08-02 — 5-Year Local Flat-File Price History Priority (ANTIGRAVITY).** Added `fetchLocalFlatFileHistory(symbol)` as the #1 primary tier in `src/lib/history.ts` (`fetchDailyOHLC`) and `fetchGroupedBarsLocal(date)` in `src/lib/market-signals/massive.ts`. Any pre-hoarded 5-year Massive flat files (`data/history-5y/`, `data/massive-history/`) are read directly from disk without hitting external REST APIs, providing instant zero-cost history for backtests and Congress.Trade EOD price feeds (`/api/market/prices/[symbol]`, `/api/market/spx`). Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-local-flatfile-history-priority.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Mobile PWA owner-feedback round (Monet, cloud session).** Branch
`agent/antigravity/mobile-pwa-feedback` (applying patch from Monet): PWA gets
an Accounts section (switch broker account via `account.activate`, sign-out link to switch Google/Apple
login), per-proposal realtime approve/reject feedback (tapped button spins; card follows its queued
command through queued/running/succeeded/failed instead of failures hiding in the Command Log), and the
delete-account panel is collapsed behind a neutral link so it stops mimicking error banners. tsc clean,
mobile test file 10/10, lint 0 errors. Landed as #2351 (`44069368`).
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-mobile-pwa-owner-feedback.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Data-provider hardening, Round 1 (MONET, `monet/data-cascade-freshness`,
merged as #2353).** Implemented the free-tier research doc's own recommendations: Tiingo
now ALSO an OHLC-history source in `history.ts` (was enrichment-only — a configured key
delivered none of the promised adjusted-history value until this landed), dead Stooq tier
removed (confirmed PoW-bot-walled), keyless Treasury.gov yield-curve fallback (3M/2Y/10Y +
curves, no FRED key needed), Cboe VIX9D, SEC-XBRL `revenueGrowth`. Full gates green.
Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-data-provider-hardening.md`.

**2026-08-02 — Data-provider hardening, Round 2/3 (MONET, `monet/data-cascade-providers-round2`).**
Closes out the rest of the same research doc: 3 new key-gated fundamentals/news providers
(Wisesheets, SimFin, Marketaux — all dormant until their env key is set), 2 new keyless
sources (BLS macro fallback wired into the Macro board, Nasdaq earnings-calendar backfill),
an S&P 500 constituents mirror (built, not yet wired to replace the static universe list —
see the rollout note), Yahoo 429 hardening, and Alpha Vantage/Finnhub earnings-calendar
fallbacks. USAspending.gov investigated and correctly NOT implemented (no free
recipient→ticker crosswalk exists). Full gates green: lint 0 errors, tsc clean, 5891/5891
tests, build clean. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-data-provider-round2.md`.

## Blockers

1. **RESOLVED 2026-08-02 — auto-deploy was broken by a webhook HMAC mismatch.** Every push
   to `refs/heads/main` was answered by Coolify with
   `[{"status":"failed","message":"Invalid signature."}]` (visible only in the GitHub hook
   delivery RESPONSE BODY — the hook page showed green 200s throughout), so no deployment
   was ever created; the queue sat empty and the single 2026-08-01 deploy was the owner's
   manual click. Repair: synced the GitHub hook secret to the Coolify app's
   `manual_webhook_secret_github`, deleted the exact-duplicate second hook, redelivered the
   newest main push -> a real deployment was created immediately, and
   `scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh 19dfd51b` reported **PASS** (~04:47Z). Merge==live is
   trustworthy again. Also fixed: AGENTS.md's stale Coolify uuid (the app is `socratic-app`
   now). Full receipts + recurrence warning:
   `docs/rollouts/2026-08-02-deploy-webhook-secret-repair.md`.

2. **RESOLVED — npm `EALLOWSCRIPTS` on the shared git dep (and the earlier explanation
   here was wrong).** A clean-shell reproduction with the repo's exact files PASSES: the
   repo as committed installs fine, and a stale `allowScripts` tag was NOT the trigger.
   The real triggers (npm 11.16.0+, upstream bug npm/cli#9783, open, unfixed through npm
   12.0.2): an `allow-scripts=...` line in ANY `.npmrc` layer, or an inherited
   `npm_config_allow_scripts` env var — npm forwards it into its git-dep preparation
   subprocess, which rejects it as a flag. This Mac had live `npx`-launched processes
   exporting `npm_config_allow_scripts=@wasp.sh/wasp-cli`; any shell descending from that
   lineage fails every `npm ci` instantly. If EALLOWSCRIPTS appears: check
   `env | grep npm_config_allow_scripts` and relaunch the contaminated parent — and NEVER
   add `allow-scripts` to `.npmrc`, even though npm's own error message suggests it.
   Also fixed forward: `allowScripts` git-dep keys in tag form (`#vX.Y.Z`) can never match
   (npm compares against the resolved 40-char SHA), which npm 12 escalates from a warning
   to a hard block on the dep's `prepare` — the key is now committish-free
   (`"github:jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared": true`, verified: coverage warning
   gone). #2345's lockfile regen also fixed a real silent bug: the old lockfile pinned the
   v2.3.0 commit while package.json said v2.4.x, so `npm ci` was silently shipping the old
   shared package. Verified 2026-08-02: plain `npm ci` = exit 0, 575 packages, clean shell.
   (An earlier copy of this blocker blamed a stale `allowScripts` tag — corrected above;
   the union merge briefly duplicated both versions here, de-spliced 2026-08-02.)

3. **Two provider lanes are degraded and need an owner decision, not an agent fix.**
   FMP's plan probe returns 403 (subscription state) and Massive is history-capped to the
   free tier. Agents must not provision replacement keys. Several optional/telemetry lanes
   (Usage Monitor, VIX-Yahoo, Nasdaq Quote, some RapidAPI lanes) are also down; those are
   fallback tiers and the cascade still serves real data.

## Next action

- Watch that `c117afb9` (and subsequent merges) deploy organically via the repaired
  webhook — `bash scripts/verify-deploy-sha.sh` after merging.
- (Retracted: the `schedulerLease.owner` "residual" flagged earlier does not exist — the
  landed code already strips the pid for unauthenticated callers; prod serves the bare
  instance uuid. Observation was made against the pre-deploy payload.)
- Owner decisions pending: FMP subscription, Massive plan tier; and whether hook-secret
  re-sync should be added to the Coolify app-recreate recipe (see the 2026-08-02 rollout
  note — if recreation regenerated the secret, this failure recurs on the next recreate).

## Conventions that bite (do not re-derive these)

- **Board files are `merge=union`.** `.gitattributes` union-merges `STATUS.md`,
  `PLAN.md`, and `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` so concurrent PRs do not conflict on them. The cost
  is that union **interleaves** both sides instead of conflicting, which silently produces
  duplicated rows and entries spliced under the wrong heading. `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` had 13
  exact-duplicate blocks from this (deduped 2026-08-01) and `STATUS.md` had one agent's
  notes filed under another's heading (preserved as evidence in `docs/status-archive.md`).
  Keep entries to a single line where you can, and re-read your own row after a merge.
- **Node 24 is required.** The Mac's default `node` is v26 and mass-fails the suite on a
  `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@24/bin:$PATH"`.

**2026-08-04 — Model slug migration tests and UI mapping fixes (Antigravity).**
Fixed `gpt-5.4-mini` regex inclusion in reasoning model capabilities which was causing test suite failures under Node 24. Also cleaned up `MODEL_DISPLAY_NAME` in `app/console/lib/models.ts` to strictly follow user-provided slugs, completely removing any legacy `-latest` suffixes. Verified tests locally.

**2026-08-04 — Revert accidental marketScan in from-draft preview (Antigravity).**
Fixed `test/chat-draft-policy.test.ts` test regression. A previous commit accidentally added a `fetchFreshQuotesCascade` call to the preview evaluation in `app/api/proposals/from-draft/route.ts`. Since the mock test broker returns real time quotes, this caused the "scan-less" preview to actually fetch a fresh quote and skip the expected `staleness_gate` block in tests. Reverted the addition so the preview returns to its scan-less state. All 10/10 tests pass, `land.sh` executed.
