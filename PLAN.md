# Active Implementation Plan

> **2026-08-20 CURSOR-BUGBOT — Owner-cancel stop tombstone on cancel timeout (`cursor/cancel-timeout-stop-tombstone`).** Persist the do-not-replace tombstone when `cancelEquityOrder` throws (e.g. #2886 deadline) so reconcile cannot re-place a stop the owner just cancelled.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-owner-cancel-stop-tombstone-timeout.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR-BUGBOT — #2953 peer quotes/intraday middleware pass-through (`cursor/peer-quotes-intraday-middleware`).** Same bearer exception as `/api/market/prices` and `/api/market/spx`.  Flatfile stays session-gated.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-peer-quotes-intraday-middleware.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR-BUGBOT — Owner-cancel stop tombstone on lookup miss (`cursor/owner-cancel-stop-tombstone-lookup`).** Use the tracked `broker_protective_stops` symbol when the advisory cancel lookup is empty so reconcile cannot re-place a stop the owner just cancelled.  Did not touch #2861.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-owner-cancel-stop-tombstone-lookup.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — Stale hosting/stack copy sweep (`cursor/stale-hosting-docs-b392`).** Docs/metadata only.  Production is Coolify at socratictrade.com (README + GitHub About already said so — kept).  PLAN Current Status / acceptance still had Mac pm2 + `trading-beta`.  AGENTS leftover present-tense preview/PWA/Mac-pm2.  PWA UI retired #2801.  No product code.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-stale-hosting-docs.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — Rebase #2818 (`cursor/delayed-yahoo-fallback-stamp-c120`).** Rebase-only onto `origin/main` `ce31c367`.  Stamp **Delayed Quote** on approval cards; keep trading.  Conflicts: DataSourcesSettings + HomeView — kept main.  Do not merge.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-delayed-yahoo-fallback-stamp.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — #2854 rebased onto main (`ce31c367`).** CONFLICTING/DIRTY was phantom (`merge-tree` clean).  Kept gather inventory skip + 502/429 fail-open.  Did not absorb other clusters.  Do not merge.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-gather-no-pinecone-inventory.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — #2854 rebased onto main (`eefc4f82`).** Real conflict was `test/roic-transcripts.test.ts` vs #2813.  Kept gather `shouldSkipWholeIndexInventory` test + main's skip-covered ROIC test.  Did not absorb #2813 product.  Do not merge.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-gather-no-pinecone-inventory.md`.

> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — Rebase #2841 onto `1d6bbf68` (`cursor/notification-history-parity-4bbc`).** After #2892/#2876/#2942/#2834.  Same inbox scope only.  One last-100 snapshot field.  Not merging.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-notification-history-parity.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — Rebase #2841 onto current main (`cursor/notification-history-parity-4bbc`).** Rebased onto `origin/main` `ce31c367`.  Same notification-history scope only.  Kept main's `latestScan` snapshot field and this PR's last-100 inbox.  Not merging.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-notification-history-parity.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — Rematch #2798 onto current main (`cursor/alert-noise-retired-boot-64c1`).** Unique leftover after #2799/#2800: 5 min live-boot connection-alert mute + stamp `intentionalOff` in `getServiceHealthSummaries`.  Kept main's `pineconeIngest` and kind-based hard-stop.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-17-alert-noise-retired-boot.md`.
> **2026-08-17 CURSOR — Alert-noise leftover (`cursor/alert-noise-retired-boot-64c1`).** Owner 4:23–4:38pm CT burst was mostly the 21:35Z Coolify restart plus leftover FilingAPI 401s and expected-limit 429s. Stamp retired vendors OFF in health summaries; ops-snapshot `ok` matches hard-stop only; mute connection pages for 5 min on live boot. Do not raise Pinecone/Anthropic/AV budgets. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-17-alert-noise-retired-boot.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — Web / iOS parity P1+P2 (`cursor/web-ios-parity-fixes-e83a`, #2942).** Implements audit #2804 findings: web/iOS deep-link focus, iOS Activity alerts, Exit-only copy, a11y, Watchlist cards, PWA UI deletion, Playwright 390 landmark smoke.  P3 backlog stays open (replace-at-market, widgets, wash-sale, Insights rename).  Dispatched verify green on `d52b354a`; merged `origin/main` `ee1286e0`.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-web-ios-parity-fixes.md`.

> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Pinecone trial end in 7 days (`cursor/pinecone-trial-end-7d-c9a3`).** Owner: move the app Standard-trial snap from 2026-08-30 to 2026-08-27T00:00:00.000Z (7 days from 2026-08-19 21:59 CT). Infisical `PINECONE_TRIAL_ENDS_AT` + code default. Pinecone console trial unchanged. Daily WU fuse unchanged. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-pinecone-trial-end-7d.md`.

> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — OCR CPU ceiling 5 of 8 (`cursor/deploy-freshness-ocr-isolate-d4cf`, #2545).** Default isolation cap is 5.0 vCPU (cpu-shares 256): as high as is reasonably advisable on the shared cx43.  Leaves 3 cores for Coolify/ST/UM.  CT compose `scan-cpu-worker` is still 2.0 -- raise that line to 5.0 for the durable cap.  Do not take prod down.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-17-deploy-freshness-ocr-isolate.md`.

> **2026-08-17 CURSOR — Deploy freshness + shared-box OCR isolation (`cursor/deploy-freshness-ocr-isolate-d4cf`, #2545).** Standing cron pages when the oldest undeployed main commit is >1h old (silent-freeze class: webhook 200s, health green on old sha).  Isolation script dry-runs a no-restart CPU cap on CT OCR/scan workers.  Remaining constraint: Coolify/CT-repo limits and retry-on-255 are not settable from this repo.  Do not take prod down.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-17-deploy-freshness-ocr-isolate.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — Web / iOS parity P1+P2 (`cursor/web-ios-parity-fixes-e83a`).** Implements audit #2804 findings: web/iOS deep-link focus, iOS Activity alerts, Exit-only copy, a11y, Watchlist cards, PWA UI deletion, Playwright 390 landmark smoke.  P3 backlog stays open (replace-at-market, widgets, wash-sale, Insights rename).  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-web-ios-parity-fixes.md`.

> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — Alert repeat lock (`cursor/alert-repeat-lock-2b9b`).** Cluster `alert-repeat-lock`.  **IN PR #2877.**  60s same-fingerprint delivery lock on `price_alert` (by id) plus `provider_degraded` / `budget_alert` / `kill_switch`.  Reuses `notification_events` sent rows.  Health/usage same-channel fallback no longer double-sends.  Did not revert #2865 or take `alert-push-delivery`.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-alert-repeat-lock.md`.

> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Price alert evaluation (`cursor/fix-price-alert-evaluation-1a3d`).** Part II cluster `price-alert-evaluation`.  User-scoped `fetchFreshQuotesCascade`, logged `alert.check_error`, staleness gate, `isValidAppSymbol`.  Did not take on alert-push-delivery.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-price-alert-evaluation.md`.
> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Session-aware market cache freshness (`cursor/market-cache-freshness-5ee3`).** Expert review cluster `market-cache-freshness` / mdi-01.  Friday intraday cache writes keep naive TTL; bar freshness is session-counted; early-close table added.  Sibling `quote-value-provenance` is a separate PR.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-market-cache-freshness.md`.
> **2026-08-20 CURSOR — Wire dead controls (`cursor/wire-dead-controls-8b69`).** Expert review `dead-controls` cluster: Results net-of-tax toggle, policy webhook Send test, Strategy preset CRUD.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-20-wire-dead-controls.md`.
> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Account write guards (`cursor/account-write-guards-940d`).** Expert review tranche-1 `account-write-guards`.  Pin `strategyAuthority` on copy paths; block draining reactivation.  No new TypedConfirm.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-account-write-guards.md`.
> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — #2854 rebased onto main (`52add2ae`).** CONFLICTING/DIRTY after #2856/#2857/#2858.  `merge-tree` was clean; overlap was STATUS/PLAN/EFFORT-LOG only, not iOS.  Kept gather inventory skip + 502/429 fail-open.  Live still `a8a0a65b`; this morning's Roth/Paper runs hit 8m `strategy gather timeout`, Green never started.  Do not flip write-class or prune.  Do not touch #2841/#2849/#2850/#2856/#2857.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce / TF.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-gather-no-pinecone-inventory.md`.
> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Broker I/O deadlines (`cursor/broker-io-deadlines-85a9`).** Part II `broker-io-deadlines`: deadlines on Alpaca quotes/place/cancel + Tradier fetch; scheduler protective lanes use `withDeadline`; default `getEquityOrders` scoped to open + 24h terminal.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-broker-io-deadlines.md`.
> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Phone touch viewport (`cursor/phone-touch-viewport-b809`).** Review cluster `phone-touch-viewport`: chrome budget, 44px touch targets, overlay scroll-lock/history/visualViewport.  Did not take phone-layout-density or visual-tokens-theme-contrast.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-phone-touch-viewport.md`.
> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — FTS indexed mirror idempotency (`cursor/event-loop-pins-fts-indexed-mirror-5b2a`).** Part II `event-loop-pins`: side-key index + bounded mirror/yield/strategy gate on `persistLocalComplete` and filing-body ingest.  Did not flip write-class or prune.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-fts-indexed-mirror-idempotency.md`.

> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — iOS web parity (`cursor/ios-web-parity-502f`, #2857).** #2856 is live on `main` (`a8a0a65b`); TF 1.0.68 is behind.  No leftover iOS slug join on current main.  Folds #2849 Desk subtitle; Home / Insights / Guardrails no longer send users to a missing Strategy page.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce / TF.  HOLD `5674dfaf`.  Do not touch #2841 / #2854 / #2840.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-ios-web-parity.md`.

> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Indices common names (`#2856` `a8a0a65b` MERGED).** TF 1.0.68 is still the pre-#2855 binary.  Follow-up iOS chrome is `cursor/ios-web-parity-502f`.

> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Indices labels (`#2855` `b27de85c` MERGED).** Follow-up is `cursor/indices-common-names-3381`.

> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Robinhood quote chunk (`cursor/robinhood-quote-chunk-befc`, #2852).** Rebased onto #2853 `df1f5a37`.  Live `9d71dda4` died on `too many symbols (max 10, got 250)` 18s into gather.  Chunk Robinhood quote/tradability/fundamentals to 10.  Do not shrink the universe.  congress.trade 404 must not latch the free wave.  Do not reopen #2840 / #2848 / #2853.  Do not touch #2850 / #2849 / #2841.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce / TF.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-robinhood-quote-chunk.md`.
> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Gather no Pinecone inventory + 502/429 fail-open (`cursor/gather-no-pinecone-inventory-befc`).** Same `9d71dda4` terminal.  Fold in #2852 (`c7b775c5`); do not replace the ≤10 Robinhood chunk.  Pause whole-index Pinecone list/fetch while a run is queued/running.  congress.trade 502 and Massive 429 fail-open.  No OpenRouter strategy/completion in that window — only `usage_budget_status` then the crash.  Do not flip write-class or prune.  Do not reopen #2840.  Do not touch #2850 / #2849 / #2841.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-19-gather-no-pinecone-inventory.md`.

> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — Manual Run once drain handoff (`#2853` `df1f5a37` MERGED).** Drain resumes a claimed Manual Run once with no live heartbeat.  Remaining gather-pricing hole is #2852.

> **2026-08-18 CURSOR — getAccounts loop budget + ROIC/FTS yield (`cursor/getaccounts-loop-budget-befc`, #2848).** VERIFY_FAIL: alpaca-mcp getAccount retry hung 60s under the 16s live wait.  Mock a short first-call budget in that test.  Sweep must not call a same-process stall a restart (Roth `b3b83913`).  Keep ROIC/FTS pause + 16s wait.  Do not skip the test.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-getaccounts-loop-budget.md`.

> **2026-08-18 CURSOR — sweep-failed request lock (`#2847` `4abfb7fa` MERGED).** Leftover `running` request after sweep-failed `0e5ccd66` no longer locks Manual Run once.  Roth wrote `b3b83913` at 23:13:25Z.  Follow-up starvation is #2848.
> **2026-08-19 CURSOR — iOS Scan last-good on 503 (`cursor/ios-scan-last-good-503-b104`).** Live web Refresh keeps last-good; iOS did not.  503 cause: empty-screener Yahoo whole-set of ~5k names misses the 35s / edge budget before seed.  Seed first; snapshot `latestScan`; iOS keeps the universe.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce / second TestFlight / Manual Run.  Do not touch #2848/#2849/#2841/#2840.

Live `/api/scan` still 503s without names.  Seed-first `/api/scan` is the 1.0.68 unblocker; iOS `latestScan` kept for the next TF.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce / second TestFlight.

> **2026-08-18 CURSOR — sweep-failed request lock (`cursor/sweep-request-orphan-lock-befc`, #2847).** #2845 live; 0 new Roth `strategy_runs` after 22:06:43Z.  Orphan `0e5ccd66` sweep-failed 22:13:05Z (0 LLM) left the request `running`.  Close on sweep / `finishStrategyRun`; heal on tick and on the next click.  Portfolio `8000+7000ms` is a separate lock.  Do not merge / deploy / bounce.  Do not touch #2841.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-sweep-failed-request-lock.md`.

> **2026-08-18 CURSOR — getAccounts post-deploy timeout (`cursor/getaccounts-post-deploy-timeout-befc`).** Dashboard 6s `getAccounts` race fail-closes Manual Run once via `accountReadiness`.  Paper/Roth are Alpaca REST.  First-call retry + 15s combined budget; do not hide a real broker-down.  Do not bounce Coolify.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-getaccounts-post-deploy-timeout.md`.

> **2026-08-18 CURSOR — rag-embed DeepInfra batch-window (`#2840` `5674dfaf` MERGED).** Live 32-text embed POSTs 400 at 8193 tokens on baai/bge-m3 (batch-sum, not one unchunked 10-K).  Hybrid condense-first stayed; token-pack is after that step.  Isolate one over-limit condensed text; do not fail the companions.  Do not flip write-class or prune.  Do not re-clamp the #2800 fuse.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-rag-embed-batch-window.md`.
> **2026-08-18 GROK — Live prod triage (`grok/prod-triage-2026-08-18`, #2833).** Rematch #2831/#2830 so Autopilot and Scan can recover.  Unclaimed code: coalesce Alpaca `getAccount` (Roth dashboard 6s timeout).  Do not rewrite Cursor money-path PRs.  Do not touch L2/L3 B2.

> **2026-08-18 CURSOR — notification history + web/iOS inbox (`cursor/notification-history-parity-4bbc`).** Reopen later alerts on both surfaces from existing `notification_events`.

Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-18-notification-history-parity.md`.

> **2026-07-17 - OpenRouter Model Stats Canonicalization (Antigravity, branch `antigravity/openrouter-universal-routing`).** Implemented server-side model-id canonicalization (`cleanModelId`) inside `aggregateModelStats` and `normalizeBenchmarkSummaries` in `src/lib/model-stats.ts` to strip provider prefixes (like `openai/`, `google/`, etc.) from qualified OpenRouter model IDs. This ensures that usage, latency, closed trades, and benchmark summaries are aggregated and mapped back to their bare catalog model base names (e.g., `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gemini-3.5-flash`), preventing stats split and lookup mismatch in the Model Stats drawer. Verified via vitest and compiler checks. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-17-openrouter-model-stats-canonicalization.md`.
## 2026-07-16 — OpenRouter Catalog Integration & JSON Repair (ANTIGRAVITY)

Added OpenRouter models to `app/ui/llm-model-catalog.ts` so they can be selected for Green and Red teams. Local response healing via `jsonrepair` integrated globally via `extractJsonPayload` without model-specific fallback calls. `better-sqlite3` native modules rebuilt for Node 24. Tests passed, ready for `main` deployment.

> **2026-07-17 - SEC/RAG Backfill: Advanced RAG Backfill Improvements (Antigravity/AG, branch `agent/ag-rag-backfill-p3`).** Implemented Advanced RAG Backfill improvements (RAG-B08, RAG-B09, RAG-B10, RAG-B13, RAG-B14). Optimized the SEC filings discovery pipeline to check stashed SQLite filings first, dynamically skip online discovery if enough stashed filings satisfy the run's cap, and globally sort the queue breadth-first (newest 10-K, then newest 10-Q). Implemented dynamic raw-artifact local caching in the queue worker to bypass duplicate network fetches. Added a two-stage RAG query (scouting all candidates dynamically with `limit = 1` and deep-scanning finalists + holdings with `limit = 8`), grouping narrative chunks and structured facts/Form-4 transactions cards into prompt-injected symbol dossiers. Expanded the admin coverage dashboard at `/api/admin/rag-coverage` to query the entire database directly and report model, parser, and date ranges. Fully verified type safety, Next.js build, and 51/51 tests passing. Ready to push and merge.

> **2026-07-16 - SEC/RAG Backfill: Phase 3 — HTML Parsing and Chunker (Antigravity/AG, branch `agent/ag-rag-backfill-p3`).** Implements cheerio-based HTML parser (`parseFilingHtml` in `src/lib/web-sources/sec-parser.ts`) to strip script/style/hidden tags, normalize Item/Part section headers, and reconstruct clean pipe-delimited Markdown tables (grouping/splitting large tables to fit token caps). Updated chunker in `src/lib/rag/chunk.ts` to be section-aware (resetting overlap across sections) and use token-aware estimation. Integrated this parser in `ingestFiling` inside `src/lib/web-sources/sec-filings.ts` to ingest bodies with parser revision `sec-edgar-filing-v2`. Verified via newly added unit test suite in `test/sec-parser.test.ts` (100% green), existing `sec-filings` tests, and a successful Next.js production build check. Opening PR.

> **2026-07-15 - SEC/RAG Backfill: Phase 2 — Discovery and Archive (Antigravity/AG).** Implements Phase 2 (Discovery and Archive) of the SEC/RAG 1,000-stock high-yield backfill plan. Built a host-wide `SecRateLimiter` class (token bucket, 4 req/sec default) with dynamic 429 `Retry-After` backoff handling. Integrated this rate limiter into `politeFetch` calls in `http.ts` for all `.sec.gov` requests. Implemented a local raw-artifact caching layer in `sec-filings.ts` to check, save, and retrieve SEC documents locally before hitting the network. Added historical submissions JSON shard traversal (supporting filings listed in `filings.files` when limit is not met by `recent`). Created the `fetchFilingDirectory` helper to download and parse `index.json` directory structures for future exhibit resolution. Verified via newly added test suite in `test/sec-backfill-p2.test.ts` (100% green), existing `sec-filings` tests, and a successful Next.js production build check. Merged as PR #1665.

## SEC/RAG 1,000-stock implementation train

**Status: In progress; corpus writes gated**

**2026-07-22 routing boundary:** strategy callers must declare information needs. Current
prices, portfolio/positions, orders, SEC XBRL facts, and Form 4 transactions stay deterministic;
only filing/transcript/lesson/research narrative is eligible for semantic retrieval. Unknown needs
fail closed. Next integration is to make the same contract the shared entry point for chat and the
evidence-consumption receipt, without changing the trading verdict path.

- **[~] Wave A — prerequisite truth:** the versioned/checksummed universe acceptance contract and durable
  job/task state with leases, strict transitions, retries, dead-letter/quarantine, verification receipts, and
  replay invariants merged in PR #1543 after local/hosted gates. Corrected universe selection, census truth, and
  adversarial integration remain in progress. Three post-merge P2 durability findings (failure reasons, checksum
  immutability, lease config) are locally green on `codex/sec-rag-foundation-postmerge` in ready PR #1559.
  Production is verified on foundation release `cbe3e532`; hosted follow-up acceptance and corpus gates remain.
- **[~] Wave B — source correctness:** discover recent plus historical submission shards and filing exhibits;
  archive immutable raw artifacts; enforce one aggregate SEC limiter; parse DOM/iXBRL sections, tables, units,
  contexts, and footnotes; chunk against provider token budgets.
- **[~] Wave C — structured and searchable evidence:** normalize XBRL, insider, ownership, offering, and event
  facts; add a true corpus-wide lexical index; fuse dense/lexical recall, rerank wide, diversify, and return
  typed evidence packets with strict point-in-time filtering. The read-only FTS5 source in
  `src/lib/rag/corpus-wide-lexical.ts` is now wired default-off beside dense recall before one rerank,
  with tenant, rights, committed-version, and stale-legacy guards.
- **[ ] Wave D — evaluation and consumption:** build real-EDGAR parser/fact/retrieval/grounding fixtures and
  metrics; replace the generic three-chunk strategy blob with issuer-scoped scout/deep dossiers and verified
  evidence references.
  - **[~] Production-path retrieval evaluator (2026-07-21):** `eval:rag-production` calls
    `retrieveContextDetailedWithStatus` with immutable authoritative-as-of timestamps, real vector-id
    diagnostics plus stable provenance relevance selectors, machine-readable relevance/PIT/coverage/latency/usage receipts, and explicit comparison labels.
    Curate version-controlled JSON cases from frozen EDGAR evidence and run controlled shadow comparisons before changing defaults.
  - **[~] Hosted-inference candidate (2026-07-21):** benchmark Pinecone `/embed` and `/rerank` directly
    against frozen candidate pools before assuming self-hosted or routed BGE/Cohere is best. This is bounded
    by absolute CLI caps, read-only, account-availability-gated, and it never touches the production index.
- **[ ] Wave E — controlled operations:** only after gates, run shadow 10 -> 25 -> 100 -> 300 -> 1,000 breadth-
  first waves with cost/rate/failure breakers, reconciliation, dual-read/write, rollback, and freshness SLOs.

The highest-yield backfill order remains: freeze the exact 1,000-CIK universe plus a private priority overlay;
archive immutable raw SEC artifacts broadly; embed 10-K/10-Q decision sections, material 8-K exhibits, and only
entitled transcripts selectively; retain XBRL/fundamentals as structured facts; checkpoint by CIK/accession; and
expand only after each 10 -> 25 -> 100 -> 300 -> 1,000 wave passes coverage, citation, PIT, cost, and failure gates.
The production bulk worker must consume historical submissions shards rather than recent-only discovery. Crash
repair must combine provider-page ghost cleanup with a local keyset whole-commit verifier; never page an exact-set
commit reconciliation in a way that can split one commit across pages, and never rewrite PIT intervals/heads during
repair. No 1,000-stock provider or corpus write is authorized yet.

Node 24 remains the supported runtime. Node 26 is installed on the host but is not adopted while `.nvmrc`, CI,
production, and the `better-sqlite3` native ABI are pinned to 24.

## Codex Audit Wave 0: Base Guardrails
**Status: In Progress**

- **[x] PR 1: X0.1 & X0.2 Safety Maintenance & Draining Fence**
  - X0.1 Safety Maintenance Coordinator: Run all side-effecting sweeps (fill reconciliation, stale intents, stale exits, synthetic stops) strictly before strategy admission, with strict network deadlines (15s). Ensures side effects execute exactly once per tick and never hang the singleflight guard.
  - X0.2 Draining Fence: Hard pre-placement veto if the account's state is `draining` or `deleted`. Capture `accountNumber` and `policyRevision` onto the `strategy_runs` snapshot.
  *(Completed 2026-07-12)*
- **[x] PR 2: X0.3 Exit Replacement State Machine**
  - Migrated limit order market-replacements to a robust, database-backed state machine.
  - Added original order detail columns (symbol, side, type, quantity, filled quantity) to SQLite schema and reconstructed orders when missing from broker.
  - Implemented auto-mode-off continuation and full reconciliation/recovery for in-flight `replacement_submitted` rows.

# Improvement Plan - Socratic Trade

Eight-phase roadmap to make the dashboard genuinely autonomous, more accurate,
measurable, customizable, and easier to operate. The current codebase is treated
as partially complete; implementation should preserve working controls while
filling the missing pieces.

> using existing components first. Merged forward to current `origin/main` and verified on the
> current tree; lightweight-charts adoption and broader live-stream fanout stay deferred until
> this slice lands cleanly.

> **2026-07-04 - Shared public dependency hardening (Codex).** No roadmap scope change. Socratic
> now consumes `congress-trading-shared` from the public HTTPS git tag instead of GitHub Packages,

> **2026-07-04 - Console scan column customization parity (Codex subagent).** `/console/scan`

> **2026-07-04 - Approvals triage + alert center focused slice (Codex).** No roadmap scope change.
> `/console/approvals` now covers the first operational triage layer from issue #470: sort/filter,
> visible-row multi-select, bulk reject, and safe non-LIVE bulk approve through the existing
> proposal endpoints; LIVE typed-confirm remains per-item only. The console's alert history also
> graduates into a reusable alert-center surface (summary buckets + search + better notification

> owner inbox across more object types, keyboard triage, and any broader console/live-data/settings
> work.
> **2026-07-04 - Coach/framework primitives slice (Codex, issue #473).** No roadmap scope change.
> This branch is a focused primitive-wiring pass: the decision-trace coach flow can now attach a
> note while optionally promoting it into a lesson or linked framework proposal, framework review
> persists explicit owner rewrite/accept/reject verb semantics plus `ownerResponse`, and the trace
> surfaces linked run metadata when the originating run exists. 2026-07-05 update: the branch is
> now merge-forwarded to `origin/main` @ `0bfa4f1e` and fully green on focused + full verification

> **2026-07-04 - Test Account + usage-limit email alerts (Codex).**
> Branch `codex/restore-test-account-option` restores an explicit local mock paper account option
> labeled `Test Account - Local Mock Paper Account`. It is addable for simulation/learning trades but
> is never default-created or default-selected. The same branch adds a shared usage-limit alert path:
> Pinecone daily Write Unit fuse trips, RAG ingest text caps, provider rate/quota/billing failures,

> **2026-07-04 - RAG filing ingest smoke + deterministic vector ids (Codex).**
> Branch `codex/rag-filing-ingest-smoke-fix` verified production writes/searches the new
> `socratic-trade` Pinecone index by ingesting one MSFT 10-Q. The successful state is 95 vectors,
> 95 local `document_chunks`, and accession `0001193125-26-191507` recorded in

> **2026-07-03 - Console polish + RAG quota/usage safeguards (Codex).**
> Branch `codex/console-actions-evidence-live` merged as PR #351. It extended the Socratic console polish pass and
> adds RAG quota protections before fresh Pinecone keys are connected: app-recorded RAG usage is labeled
> separately from provider totals, Pinecone query rows record Read Units when available, upsert rows

> **2026-07-03 — Socratic Trade autonomy UI/runtime implementation (Codex).** The branch

> **2026-07-03 — Run-state UX correction (Codex).** The console header no

> **2026-07-03 - IRA wash-sale UI correction (Codex).** The settings and
> guardrails UI now make the IRA distinction explicit: same-account IRA wash
> sales are ignored/not applicable, so Roth/traditional IRA accounts no longer
> surface the taxable-account Block / Ask / Auto selector as the relevant
> control. The only IRA wash-sale choice shown is the existing cross-account

> **2026-07-03 - Console universe index exclusivity fix (Codex).** The

> only inherits the env default on `undefined`/blank; (b) RAG (Voyage/Pinecone) spend from the
> `rag_usage` ledger now counts toward the same ceiling as `llm_usage`, so RAG-only spend can trip the
> cap (previously it could not); (c) the retrieval RAG meters (`meterEmbed`/`meterPineconeQuery`/
> `meterRerank` in `retrieveContextDetailed`) now book under the requesting `userId` instead of defaulting
> to `"local"` — otherwise a non-`local` user's retrieval spend was never counted against *their* ceiling,
> silently defeating (b) for the multi-user case. Covered by `test/llm-budget-enforcement.test.ts` and
> `test/rag-metering.test.ts`. A later pass added three more **fixed-in-code** items: (d) over-budget
> `generateReflectionSummary` no longer skips the non-LLM excursion enrichment (budget suppresses only
> the LLM reflection now); (e) a run that crosses the budget mid-run (revalidation/RAG spend) re-reads

> **Future considerations (deferred, not blocking PR #293)** — the durable per-user LLM budget now
> enforces at the spend primitives and is user-editable in Settings; known limitations left for a
> follow-up:
> 1. ~~**Concurrent-run budget reservation.**~~ **DONE (2026-07-01).** A per-USER LLM budget
>    **reservation** now closes this: `reserveLlmBudget`/`reserveLlmRunBudget`/`releaseLlmReservation` in
>    `src/lib/llm-budget.ts`, CAS'd in the `settings` KV row like `acquireStrategyLock` (no migration,
>    5-min TTL, fail-closed → skip LLM, default-OFF). `runStrategyOnce` reserves its worst-case estimate
>    at the budget gate and releases in the `finally`, so a concurrent same-user run sees the hold and
>    skips LLM instead of both overshooting. See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-01-llm-budget-reservation-toctou.md`.
> 2. ~~**Chat-path spend coverage.**~~ **DONE.** `/api/chat` calls `isOverLlmBudget(userId)` and
>    returns 429 when a cap is set and the day is spent (or the ledger cannot be read).
> 3. **Multi-account budget target.** The ceiling is keyed by `userId`, so it is a per-*user* daily cap
>    that spans all of that user's accounts, not a per-*account* cap. If a user runs several accounts and
>    the intent is an independent budget per account, the gate would need to key on the account id (and
>    the ledger read filter + the Settings UI would need a per-account budget field). Today it is
>    deliberately per-user so one runaway account can't drain a shared daily allowance unnoticed.
> 4. **(Earlier-noted) `strategy.ts` god-module split** (~3k lines) remains a separate large refactor.

## Current Status

Hosting topology: production is **[socratictrade.com](https://socratictrade.com)**
on Coolify app `socratic-app` (Hetzner fleet box).  Mac `~/apps/trading-live` /
pm2 `trading` / port `4000` and every `*.jays.services` preview hostname
(including `trading-beta`) are retired.  Local review is `npm run dev` in your
own worktree plus the verify CI gate.  See `docs/deployment.md`.

Secrets/config topology (2026-06-25): `.env.local` is git-ignored and is **not** a
secret source (only the secret-free `.env.example` is tracked), and **Infisical is
the authoritative source of truth for secret values** — the app launches through
the Infisical runner (`npm run start:secrets`), which injects them at startup, and
`REQUIRE_SECRETS_MANAGER=1` makes prod refuse to boot off a local `.env.local`. See
`docs/secrets.md` and `docs/deployment.md` → "Configuration & secrets". (The former
GCP runner was removed — Infisical is the single path.) The box authenticates with the machine
identity's **Client ID + Client Secret** (universal auth, long-lived; the runner mints a short-lived
token each launch — a raw `INFISICAL_TOKEN` is only a fallback and the Client Secret is NOT that
token). Current Coolify production injects that identity through `scripts/coolify-prod-start.sh`;
the retired Mac rollback cutover remains scripted in `scripts/infisical-prod-cutover.sh`. Shared
App-A/B secrets are pulled via an app-wins overlay
(`INFISICAL_SHARED_PROJECT_ID` + its own Client ID/Secret). This documents existing behavior; no phase
scope, timeline, or approach changed.

| # | Phase | Spec | Status |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Autonomy loop | `docs/phase-1-autonomy-loop.md` | Mostly implemented; hardening/tests remain |
| 2 | Correctness fixes | `docs/phase-2-correctness.md` | Partially implemented; sector attribution incomplete |
| 3 | Performance tracking | `docs/phase-3-performance.md` | Partially implemented; paper portfolio projection, short/cover P&L branches, broker-backed pending-fill reconciliation, and persisted `executionMode` for proposals/snapshots/fills exist. Remaining: deeper attribution/tax reporting and broader broker-paper/live lifecycle tests |
| 4 | Market data and scoring | `docs/phase-4-market-data-scoring.md` | Multi-factor scoring + TTL cache live; Finnhub/FMP/Alpha Vantage/Yahoo enrichment and VIX macro context are wired. 2026-06-16: `fcfYield`/`debtToEquity`/`epsGrowth` now feed `valueScore`/`qualityScore` and the Market Scan table. 2026-06-16 (web-sources): fixed a real bug where the scan merge dropped those fields + `senateTrades` (extracted exhaustive `applyEnrichment`); congressional + SEC-insider overlays now populate `senateTrades`/`insiderSentiment`. 2026-06-19: optional `webull-unofficial` quote enrichment is available for read-only market fields only, disabled by default and never used for execution/fills. 2026-06-19: quote-source attribution now derives broker providers (`alpaca-quotes`, `robinhood-quotes`), OHLC cache sharing is explicit, shared history fills can fulfill pending misses, and Massive grouped daily VWAP can enrich scan rows when available. 2026-06-23: quote-resolvable custom Additional Watchlist symbols missing from the Nasdaq screener are carried into Market Scan via Yahoo quote-only rows, with concrete warnings when a custom ticker cannot be priced; broad dynamic base universes now include S&P 100/OEF, Russell 2000/IWM, Nasdaq Composite, NYSE Composite, and an FT Wilshire 5000 free-screener proxy, then rank down before enrichment/LLM prompting; the candidate cap and below-cutoff outlier reserve are per-user policy settings instead of env-only defaults. 2026-06-24: MCP/provider evaluation documented; direct APIs remain the production hot path, while MCP is recommended for provider research, field exploration, and trial benchmarking only unless normalized through the cache/provenance layer. |
| 5 | Frontend refactor and charts | `docs/phase-5-dashboard-refactor.md` | Partially implemented; dashboard charts, market-scan columns, activity feed, kill-switch confirmation, actionable scan empty states, readable activity summaries, custom ticker validation, and visible runtime/render error surfaces are live |
| 6 | Customization and notifications | `docs/phase-6-customization-risk-notifications.md` | Partially implemented; profiles, risk controls, webhook settings, multi-channel direct delivery, and legacy-event direct-delivery bridge exist; notification polish remains |
| 7 | AI strategy learning loop | `docs/phase-7-strategy.md` | In progress; trade-thesis metadata, red-team debate hook, and learning-loop scaffolding exist. Outcome-aware thesis/regime/sector scorecards, Bayesian shrinkage, `candidates_considered`, `signal_snapshot`, chosen+skipped EvidenceDigest, signal-efficacy, confidence-calibration, durable skipped-name counterfactual materialization, and a 20-lot tuner gate are live. 2026-06-23: broker-paper scorecards/tuning/post-mortem now read the paper bucket with explicit `executionMode` instead of live/Test heuristics. 2026-06-25 correction: persisted MAE/MFE per closed lot (post-mortem `upsertFillExcursionsByKey`), the tuner's consumption of materialized missed opportunities, and true candidate-vs-baseline OOS validation for proposed scoring weights are all LIVE — the OOS gate now also surfaces a "not out-of-sample validated" caution when it cannot evaluate. Remaining: richer per-document digests and more tests around red-team fallback behavior. |
| 8 | Cockpit UI and Strategy Studio | `docs/phase-8-cockpit-ui.md` | Cockpit shell, tabs, Strategy Studio, and strategy tuning API are live. 2026-06-16: full redesign on branch `ui-redesign` — Tailwind 4 + Recharts + Motion, dark/light themes, command bar + Portfolio rail + tabbed workspace, slide-over feeds, modal settings, learning-loop charts. 2026-06-19/20: first-run setup state, Test/Paper/Brokerage legibility, mobile scroll recovery, compact mobile portfolio summary, grouped Operate universe controls with a one-time S&P 500 default migration, Smart Money ticker drawer fallback, and a persisted ticker-logo display preference are live. 2026-06-23: Strategy Studio owns editable Green/Red Team model choices, Run once works as a stopped-system manual proposal check, workspace/feed tabs persist across browser refresh, Macro/Market Scan hover text and title-case headings were expanded, provider/API errors are translated to plain English, the mode banner can be compacted but not hidden, a readiness strip is visible, live approval requires typed server confirmation, Settings base-index buttons support S&P/Nasdaq mutually-exclusive families plus broad dynamic universe counts, Market Scan exposes a direct gauge shortcut to Settings -> Data for candidate cap/outlier reserve controls, and the Accounts list stacks/actions better on mobile after desktop/tablet/mobile screenshot QA. 2026-06-24: shared ticker buttons now give Macro movers/news tickers the same hover/click drilldown behavior as Market Scan. 2026-06-27: unauthenticated Robinhood MCP rows show `OAuth Needed`/Reconnect rather than plain Connected, recoverable broker fallbacks render as Activity diagnostics, and the Account readiness strip/Start/Run blockers now fail closed when broker OAuth, credentials, selected-account availability, agentic eligibility, or balance/portfolio reads are broken. Remaining: replace browser prompt with a richer in-app confirmation modal and broaden mobile/keyboard e2e coverage |
| 9 | Backend web sources (scraped signals) | `docs/phase-9-web-sources.md` | 2026-06-16/17 (branch `web-sources`): `src/lib/web-sources/` reads no-free-API signals server-side — Senate eFD + Capitol Trades **congressional trades**, **SEC EDGAR Form 4** insider, and **FINRA daily short-volume** — with polite cached fetch, persistent daily refresh, scheduler hook, event candidate union, source attribution, scan/prompt/UI wiring, and a never-fabricate guarantee. Also: fixed the dropped-enrichment-field bug, plumbed technical/risk fields, `signal_snapshot` audit, thesis×regime + signal-efficacy + confidence-calibration learning, 20-lot gate, edge-aware sizing. Follow-ups now tracked in Phase 10 |
| 10 | Stronger signals, learning & UI (v2 plan) | `docs/phase-10-signals-learning-ui-v2.md` | In progress on `phase-10`: positioning/smart-money deterministic sub-score, sector scorecard, full EvidenceDigest for chosen+skipped, SEC 8-K bulletins with item-label enrichment, market breadth/internals, expanded FRED/macro metrics, Macro tab, Fama-French, Cboe SKEW/VVIX, CFTC COT, Congress.Trade confidence-capped composite + PIT export evaluator with App A `validationReadiness` / `pitValidity` fail-closed gates, technical signals, keyed OHLC cascade, batched Voyage/Pinecone RAG scaffold with paced/capped 8-K ingestion, 2026-06-20 tenant-safe RAG metadata/filter/backoff hardening with raw-user credential lookup preservation, symbol drilldown with 0-100 signal thresholds, price chart with VWAP overlay, Market Scan `vs VWAP`, first-pass prompt compaction, factor-bucket scorecards, current-scan skipped counterfactual summaries, durable/mature-horizon skipped-name counterfactual rows, configurable red-team conviction threshold, and an optional de-risk-in-crisis opening-exposure cap are live. Remaining: real App A PIT export validation once App A marks `historicalValidationReady=true`, broader adaptive prompt compaction/cache layout, production-grade filing/news digests, analyst/earnings revisions, SEC XBRL facts, post-mortem/tuning use of missed-opportunity rows, full learning-matrix UI, and broader scoring-threshold settings. |
| 11 | Multi-user & API-key management (plan) | `docs/phase-11-multi-user.md` | In progress: default-user scaffolding exists; connected accounts now keep API keys server-only in dashboard snapshots, encrypt stored credentials, preserve credentials on metadata edits, route Alpaca through the active connected account, sync Robinhood through MCP OAuth/status instead of manual keys, support Alpaca MCP client connections alongside REST, keep account connection buttons persistent in UI for multi-broker setups, derive Alpaca paper vs brokerage environment dynamically via account number `PA...` or API key `PK...`, enforce required account numbers for Alpaca, preserve user-entered Alpaca account labels in the Accounts list while showing Paper/Brokerage as environment metadata, derive execution state as Test vs Paper vs Brokerage, present supported account connect buttons in Accounts, keep Paper accounts optional and user-selected, expose a hardened Robinhood MCP HTTP/SSE transport plus `/api/broker/mcp/health`, use that health check to distinguish stored Robinhood rows from authenticated MCP sessions (`OAuth Needed` + Reconnect), expose server-side `accountReadiness` so broker visibility/backfill cannot masquerade as selected-account usability, ship Settings → Connections for provider keys and connection status, let users choose separate Green Team and Red Team OpenAI/xAI models in Strategy Studio with Green fallback, route major provider/LLM calls through `resolveApiKey(service,userId)`, scope strategy locks, paper projections, learning scorecards, tax reads, notifications, reflections, dashboard callbacks, and prompt cache keys by user, route high-impact API handlers through verified middleware identity via `resolveRequestUser`, explicitly share public/env-key market data while keeping user-keyed history private by default, track pending public OHLC misses so later shared fills can refresh prior requesters without spending another user's key, and add Infisical wrappers, local Gitleaks scanning, Sentry runtime hooks, redacted Langfuse LLM traces, npm Dependabot, Litestream scripts, and Playwright smoke tests. 2026-06-24: direct Alpaca Add Account no longer shows the endpoint explainer, live default endpoint is `https://api.alpaca.markets` while Paper remains `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2`, and Alpaca account-type parsing is best-effort from broker-returned account subtype fields. 2026-06-27: broker/data fallbacks in the account dashboard path now emit throttled `recoverable_issue` audit events. 2026-06-28: site auth now relies on Auth.js Google sessions instead of Cloudflare Access headers; `AUTH_SECRET` arms fail-closed auth, `/logout` redirects to app `/login`, and empty `ALLOWED_EMAILS` allows only primary operator aliases. GitHub CI/e2e/security workflows are deferred until push credentials include `workflow` scope. M3 complete (2026-06-21): per-user policy/profiles/prompt/tuning fully scoped; global settings seeds removed; one-time migration to copy legacy global rows to 'local' user; DELETE /api/profiles/[id] route added; two-user isolation verified by test/per-user-policy-isolation.test.ts. M6 real identity/auth is implemented with Auth.js Google fail-closed middleware, request-scoped SSR snapshots, `/login`, `/logout`, and visible signed-in/Sign out UI. M7 account deletion is implemented with preview/prepare/final-delete API, multi-step Settings -> Data UI, broker/Google/Apple limitations, in-flight trading blockers, per-user OAuth/token cleanup, and hashed deletion audit. Remaining: complete data isolation audit for any newer fills/snapshots/proposals/learning tables and add provider-account-id identity mapping before Apple private-relay identities become first-class. |
| 10 | Stronger signals, learning & UI (v2 plan) | `docs/phase-10-signals-learning-ui-v2.md` | In progress on `phase-10`: positioning/smart-money deterministic sub-score, sector scorecard, full EvidenceDigest for chosen+skipped, SEC 8-K bulletins with item-label enrichment, market breadth/internals, expanded FRED/macro metrics, Macro tab, Fama-French, Cboe SKEW/VVIX, CFTC COT, technical signals, keyed OHLC cascade, batched Voyage/Pinecone RAG scaffold with paced/capped 8-K ingestion, 2026-06-20 tenant-safe RAG metadata/filter/backoff hardening with raw-user credential lookup preservation, symbol drilldown with 0-100 signal thresholds, price chart with VWAP overlay, Market Scan `vs VWAP`, first-pass prompt compaction, factor-bucket scorecards, current-scan skipped counterfactual summaries, durable/mature-horizon skipped-name counterfactual rows, configurable red-team conviction threshold, and an optional de-risk-in-crisis opening-exposure cap are live. Remaining: broader adaptive prompt compaction/cache layout, production-grade filing/news digests, analyst/earnings revisions, SEC XBRL facts, post-mortem/tuning use of missed-opportunity rows, full learning-matrix UI, and broader scoring-threshold settings. |
| 11 | Multi-user & API-key management (plan) | `docs/phase-11-multi-user.md` | In progress: default-user scaffolding exists; connected accounts now keep API keys server-only in dashboard snapshots, encrypt stored credentials, preserve credentials on metadata edits, route Alpaca through the active connected account, sync Robinhood through MCP OAuth/status instead of manual keys, support Alpaca MCP client connections alongside REST, keep account connection buttons persistent in UI for multi-broker setups, derive Alpaca paper vs brokerage environment dynamically via the account number PA prefix, state the Alpaca Paper/Brokerage default endpoints before asking for custom endpoints, enforce required account numbers for Alpaca, derive execution state as Test vs Paper vs Brokerage, present supported account connect buttons in Accounts, keep Paper accounts optional and user-selected, expose a hardened Robinhood MCP HTTP/SSE transport plus `/api/broker/mcp/health`, use that health check silently behind the Robinhood connect action instead of a persistent disconnected status card, ship Settings → Connections for provider keys and connection status, let users choose separate Green Team and Red Team OpenAI/xAI models in Strategy Studio with Green fallback, route major provider/LLM calls through `resolveApiKey(service,userId)`, scope strategy locks, paper projections, learning scorecards, tax reads, notifications, reflections, dashboard callbacks, and prompt cache keys by user, route high-impact API handlers through verified middleware identity via `resolveRequestUser`, explicitly share public/env-key market data while keeping user-keyed history private by default, track pending public OHLC misses so later shared fills can refresh prior requesters without spending another user's key, and add Infisical wrappers, local Gitleaks scanning, Sentry runtime hooks, redacted Langfuse LLM traces, npm Dependabot, Litestream scripts, and Playwright smoke tests. GitHub CI/e2e/security workflows are deferred until push credentials include `workflow` scope. M3 complete (2026-06-21): per-user policy/profiles/prompt/tuning fully scoped; global settings seeds removed; one-time migration to copy legacy global rows to 'local' user; DELETE /api/profiles/[id] route added; two-user isolation verified by test/per-user-policy-isolation.test.ts. M6 real identity/auth is implemented with Cloudflare Access/Auth.js fail-closed middleware, request-scoped SSR snapshots, `/login`, `/logout`, and visible signed-in/Sign out UI. M7 mobile foundation adds `/api/mobile/*`, a durable audited mobile command queue, `/mobile` PWA, SwiftUI starter client, SSE status updates, and a multi-step account deletion/reset flow for Google/Apple-authenticated users. Remaining: complete data isolation audit for any newer fills/snapshots/proposals/learning tables and broaden mobile e2e coverage. |
| 12 | Architecture Blueprint | docs/architecture-blueprint.md | Completed 2026-06-20: Blueprint R1–R5 requirements (tri-state execution safety, trailing stop-loss engine, IRA taxation policy settings, multi-tenant RAG & rate limits, prompt compaction & reasoning) are fully implemented, tested, and verified. |

**Client / hosting correction (2026-08-20):** the phase-11 cells above still mention `/mobile` PWA as a live foundation.  That UI was retired in #2801 (`/mobile` redirects to `/console`).  Live clients are `/console` (desktop + phone widths) and native iOS.  `/api/mobile/*` stays the iOS API.  Production is Coolify at socratictrade.com, not Mac pm2 and not Vercel.

## Integrations (outside the phase roadmap)

- **congress.trade data-share — push** (2026-06-22, `docs/congress-trade-share.md`):
  outbound, default-OFF forwarding of this app's company refs + daily closes +
  the `^GSPC` series to `congress.trade` (App A)'s idempotent import endpoint, so
  the *shared* daily FMP quota is spent once. After-scan refs hook + once-per-day
  nightly `prices`/`spx` batch + an admin trigger route. Gated on
  `CONGRESS_TRADE_TOKEN` + `CONGRESS_SHARE_ENABLED`; token is server-only. As of
  2026-06-30, the outbound payload types, API path constants, and runtime schema
  checks come from `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared`.
- **congress.trade — receive/consume** (2026-06-22, `docs/congress-trade-consume.md`,
  contract `docs/push-to-app-b.md`): default-OFF cache-aside reads of App A's
  `/api/market/*` (history first tier), App A as the congressional source via
  `/api/transactions` (token-gated), and a push receiver (webhook + SSE) feeding the
  scan's web-signal overlay. Shared transaction/event contracts now come from
  `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared`. Inert until App A's read endpoints are live.
  Round 3 (pending App A slots): push `volume`+`insider`+`shortVolume` on the nightly batch.
- **congress.trade — return-path + analytics ownership reply** (2026-06-24,
  `docs/congress-trade-app-b-reply.md`): accepted App A's analytics ownership split
  (they own congressional-trade analytics, App B owns market/price analytics) with a
  **pull/pull** transport (no aggregate pushing either way); specified the inbound
  return-path contract App A is waiting on. Both follow-up PRs are now **BUILT**
  (additive + default-OFF):
  (1) `feat/securities-import-receiver` — `POST /api/admin/securities/import`
  (bearer `APP_B_INGEST_TOKEN`, default-closed) + a local EOD cache
  (`imported_*` tables, `db-securities-import.ts`) wired as an opt-in, density-guarded
  `fetchDailyOHLC` tier, to land App A's price/spx/ref gap-fills — **BUILT 2026-06-25**
  (`docs/rollouts/2026-06-25-app-b-securities-import-fundamentals-price-targets.md`).
  (2) `congress-share.ts` `fundamentals[]`/`analyst[]` push for App A's PR #46 slots —
  built earlier via `marketQuoteToFundamentals`/`marketQuoteToAnalyst` (sourced from the
  scan's `MarketQuote`, gated `CONGRESS_SHARE_FUNDAMENTALS_ENABLED`). Numeric price targets,
  previously null, are now ALSO fillable via the opt-in FMP `price-target-consensus` provider
  (`FMP_PRICE_TARGETS_ENABLED`) — **BUILT 2026-06-25**; they thread through the enrichment
  surface onto the quote and into `marketQuoteToAnalyst`.
  (3) **Fundamentals/analyst read-back tier** — App A now exposes
  `GET /api/market/fundamentals|analyst/:ticker` (the donated tables finally have readers);
  App B reads them via `getAppAFundamentals`/`getAppAAnalyst` + a
  `CongressTradeEnrichmentProvider` seated ahead of the paid fundamentals providers, gated by its OWN
  `CONGRESS_TRADE_FUNDAMENTALS_ENABLED` (separate from the price-read `CONGRESS_TRADE_READS_ENABLED`), with a
  `CONGRESS_TRADE_MAX_STALE_DAYS` freshness cap and `NEWS_CACHE_TTL_MS` caching
  — **BUILT 2026-06-25** (`docs/congress-trade-consume.md` §1b,
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-25-crossapp-consumer-reads.md`). Paid-call elimination is an **opt-in coverage
  hint** (`ENRICHMENT_SHORT_CIRCUIT_ENABLED`): the cascade hands paid providers a per-symbol set of the
  fields App A already covers (+ the analyst source) so they skip only the redundant SUB-calls (e.g. FMP's
  ratios-ttm / grades-consensus / price-target calls) while still fetching their unique fields
  (insider/senate); no whole provider is skipped → no field lost; default OFF. App A reads are merged
  across all fresh rows, freshness-gated by the data `date`, and negative-cached 1h (transport errors are
  NOT cached). A→B push wired (`APP_B_IMPORT_URL`+`APP_B_INGEST_TOKEN` on App A; App B needs the same token
  + `SECURITIES_IMPORT_HISTORY_TIER_ENABLED`).
- **congress.trade — App A handoff: new analytics endpoints + adjusted-close fix** (2026-06-25,
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-25-app-a-handoff-integration.md`): consumes three new App A endpoints
  now live/merging (App A PRs #77/#79/#80): `GET /api/analytics/conviction` (composite 0–100
  conviction score, gated by `CONGRESS_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`), `GET /api/analytics/ticker/{T}/backtest`
  (per-ticker post-buy return stats, on-demand), and `GET /api/analytics/conflicts` (committee
  conflict-of-interest disclosures). Conviction + conflictCount wired into the daily
  `refreshCongressAnalytics` parallel fetch and the `CongressAnalytics` overlay. Yahoo adjusted-close
  fix: `fetchYahoo` now prefers `indicators.adjclose` (split+dividend-adjusted) over raw close for
  correct multi-year returns pushed to App A. **2026-06-26 update:** conviction + conflict bulletins
  now emitted in `web-sources/index.ts`; `congressAnalyticsScore` gates on `convictionDirection=BUY`
  and adds a `convictionBoost` so conviction-only tickers reach the scan candidate set. **Deferred:**
  ticker-change/delisting map (App A priority #3); bulk-snapshot bootstrap; congress-share bypass
  for adjusted-close when CONGRESS_TRADE_READS_ENABLED tier precedes Yahoo.

## Fleet-infra tooling (host-side, no product-roadmap change)

- **Retired deploy safety + CI Sentry coverage** (2026-07-11,
  `.github/workflows/sentry-ci-report.yml`, `scripts/sentry-ci-report.py`,
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-11-retired-deploy-ci-observability.md`): removed the
  obsolete Mac/PM2 GitHub Actions deploy workflow so Coolify remains the only
  automatic production path, and synchronized Sentry failure/cron observation
  with the active workflow fleet. This is CI/operations hardening only; it does
  not change product scope, phase order, or acceptance criteria.

- **Effort-log union-merge safety net** (2026-07-10,
  `scripts/effort-log-union-merge.py`,
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-effort-log-union-merge-safety.md`): a stdlib-only,
  row-level, invariant-checked reconciler that merges the machine-local live
  effort board against the repo mirror (`docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`) **without ever
  dropping a live-only row**. This is host-side coordination tooling only — it
  changes no product code, ships no user-facing behavior, and does **not** alter
  the phase roadmap or acceptance checks above. **Follow-up (out of this PR's
  scope):** wire it into the always-on host-side `~/.claude-merge-shepherd/run.sh`
  30-minute driver so live/mirror reconciliation runs automatically; that cron
  lives outside this repo and touching it needs an owner-supervised session.

## Build Order

### Current landing closure (2026-07-14)

- Finish PR #1586 with immutable generation-bound transcript derivative IDs, exact provider/ledger
  receipts, heartbeat-fenced writes, active-generation retrieval, provider-first consecutive-clean
  erasure, account-deletion coverage, and independent private/shared rerank candidate pools.
- Treat Cloudflare Access application-token timestamps as authorization-token freshness only; require
  a matching signed Auth.js `loginAt` for post-deletion identity regeneration.
- Complete the ordered Node 24 gate and hostile re-review, merge #1607 and #1586 through their PRs,
  then verify zero open PRs plus the exact final production release. Transcript activation remains a
  separate owner/config decision gated on endpoint entitlement and commercial storage/display rights.

1. Phase 1 hardening: scheduler starts once, run lock works, market-hours state is visible.
2. Phase 2 correctness: estimated notional is authoritative and sector attribution covers all scan rows.
3. Phase 3 performance: snapshots, fills, Test vs broker-routed P&L, and run attribution.
4. Phase 4 data/scoring: provider abstraction, quote enrichment, TTL cache, factor scores.
5. Phase 5 dashboard: typed components, charts, visible loading/error states, better universe/watchlist UX.
6. Phase 6 customization: profiles, deterministic risk rules, webhook notifications.
7. Phase 7 strategy loop: persist learning metrics, harden red-team debate fallback, and keep short/cover disabled for Live until broker/accounting behavior is proven.
8. Phase 8 cockpit UX: harden strategy tuning tests, polish pane density, and add persisted tuning history if audit needs justify it.

## Acceptance Checks

- Required handoff verification: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`, then
  `npm run build`. GitHub Actions CI (`verify` workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  mirrors this sequence and is live — PRs cannot merge until `verify` goes green.
  The security, e2e, and deploy workflows remain in `ci-pending/` (require additional
  credentials / environment setup before they can be promoted to `.github/workflows/`).
- The strategy can run autonomously while enabled, without opening the dashboard.
- `strategy_run` audit events are written inside `runStrategyOnce()` and only once per executed run.
- Daily limits count reviewed `estimated_notional`, including share-quantity market orders.
- Held positions can be attributed to sectors even when they are not top scan candidates.
- Performance summaries separate live and paper results.
- Scan candidates expose provider freshness, factor score breakdowns, and bid/ask data when available.
- Dashboard shows market session, scheduler state, performance charts, active profile, risk settings, and notification status.
- Desktop dashboard fits in one viewport with internal pane scrolling and tabbed workspaces.
- Mobile and tablet layouts use normal page scrolling with the fixed cockpit
  shell reserved for desktop widths.
- Strategy tuning proposals are review-only until the user explicitly applies them.
- Native iOS uses the shared backend command queue and status model;
  phones never store provider secrets, broker credentials, or MCP tokens.
  The `/mobile` PWA UI was retired in #2801 (`/mobile` redirects to `/console`).
- Policy enforcement deterministically handles daily limits, symbol limits, sector caps, stop-loss, and take-profit rules.
- Webhook notifications are attempted only when configured and every attempt is audited.
- Error/LLM observability stays opt-in and redacted by default for account, prompt, and credential data.
- The local SQLite database has a documented Litestream replicate/restore path before production reliance.
- Production hosting is Coolify at `socratictrade.com` only.  Preview / beta
  hostnames are retired.  Do not recreate `trading-beta` or per-agent
  `*.jays.services` preview lanes.
- Agent branch landing requires a clean worktree and refuses stale semantic overlap
  when the branch and `origin/main` both changed the same files since divergence.
- Root-level manual probe artifacts such as screenshots, one-off UI scripts, and
  accidental shell-output files stay ignored so the integration worktree remains
  reserved for review and merges.
