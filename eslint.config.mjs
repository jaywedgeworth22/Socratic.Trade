// Flat ESLint config (ESLint 9 + eslint-config-next 16).
//
// `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals` already spreads the base Next config
// (React, React-Hooks, import, jsx-a11y, @next/next) and adds the
// Core Web Vitals rules; `eslint-config-next/typescript` adds the
// typescript-eslint recommended ruleset. Together they reproduce what the
// legacy `next lint` default ("next/core-web-vitals" + "next/typescript")
// enabled.
//
// Rollout note: this is wired into the required `verify` CI gate. ESLint only
// fails the build on *errors*, not warnings, so several broad rules are pinned
// to "warn" below to keep the initial baseline green while still surfacing
// issues. Tighten these to "error" and burn down the warnings over time.
