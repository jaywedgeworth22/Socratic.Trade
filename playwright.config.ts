// renders. CF_ACCESS_TRUST_EMAIL_HEADER can no longer provide that identity: since the CF-Access
// JWT hardening, the plain email header is only trusted alongside CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN +
// CF_ACCESS_AUD and a verifiable Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion, none of which CI can produce. Instead the
// smoke server runs with auth UNCONFIGURED (no AUTH_SECRET, no CF flag), which engages the
// middleware's documented dev/local fallback to PRIMARY_USER_EMAIL — the same path local
// `next start` uses. The smoke email is the server's PRIMARY_USER_EMAIL so it passes the allowlist.
